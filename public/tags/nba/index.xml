      <description>Inspired by Laura Ellis (aka @LittleMissData’s) post, Data Storytelling, I decided to take Flourish for a spin to look at NBA-team win percentages over the course of the season thus far. 🏀
As advertised, Flourish is a tool for “powerful, beautiful, easy data visualisation” that lets you “quickly turn your spreadsheets into stunning online charts, maps and interactive stories.” Clearly someone on the Flourish team and I are on the same wavelength when it comes to carnival games and data visualization, since the animated rank or relative-score chart that caught my eye turned out to be named the Horserace template.</description>
