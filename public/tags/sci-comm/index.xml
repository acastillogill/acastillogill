      <description>😎 Summer of Data Science (#SoDS18) is upon us, and (thanks to Renée (aka @BecomingDataSci)) there is already some great guidance out there. I’m a big fan of “mini” projects — and, unlike Highlander, I’m pretty sure there can only be one isn’t the name of the SoDS game.
So, I wanted to share some ideas I have for potential micro-projects…
🙌 do something by hand I know, I know — this borders on heresy.</description>

      <title>DataFramed podcast interview 📻</title>

      <description>In my personal going-on-a-podcast debut, I chatted with Hugo Bowne-Anderson for the DataCamp podcast, DataFramed. Hugo must be an amazing editor, because it even makes sense!
The episode, Data Nerdism at Large (with Mara Averick), is up on their site, along with links to some of the topics that came up. Since Hugo’s good at this stuff, I’ll just steal his blurb:
 Mara Averick, self-labelled data nerd and Tidyverse developer advocate at RStudio, speaks with Hugo about all things data: what it means to be a data nerd and how data science impacts all of our lives from thinking about toxicology to sports analytics to data for social good and civic tech.</description>

      <description>The rumors are true 😱 (ok, maybe there weren’t really any rumors), I’ll be speaking at the “Enterprise Applications of the R Language”, better known as EARL, conference in Boston. Technically, it’s a keynote (🗝📝). But, since I’ve never even given a regular note, I can’t really say whether or not there will be more 🔑s involved than usual.1
Actual real adult data scientist, David Robinson (aka @drob), will also be keynoting,2 which means you should totally go.</description>

      <description>When I found out that Amelia McNamara and Aran Lunzer were about to release their extremely awesome, interactive essay on histograms, I was quick to offer my advice in my true area of expertise: making GIFs out of video for the internet. Amelia found my infinite wisdom to be helpful, and suggested that I do a blog post about it.1 And so, here we are…
Big picture: I read a cool post by Christopher J.</description>
