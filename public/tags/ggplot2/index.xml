      <description>A very silly bit of R fun, featuring üì¶: tibbletime, tidyquant, and magick packages (as well as an awesome gif of MC Hammer by someone named bert).
The code itself (see RPub here) is a combination of Tidy time series Analysis with tibbletime by Matt Dancho, and How to Add a Logo to ggplot by Magick by Daniel P. Hadley (in which you‚Äôll learn how to make a very awesome Vincent-Vega version of an mtcars scatter-plot, below).</description>

      <description>I came upon a post by Andrew Heiss, Working with R, Cairo graphics, custom fonts, and ggplot, and couldn‚Äôt help but notice that the featured font was one I‚Äôd seen before‚Ä¶

I thought I could forget about it‚Äî move on with my life. Maybe I could just load the tidyverse, recreate Andrew‚Äôs plot, and be done with the whole thing.
library(tidyverse) # Create sample data set.seed(1234) # This makes R run the same random draw df &amp;lt;- data_frame(x = rnorm(100), y = rnorm(100)) # Create plot p &amp;lt;- ggplot(df, aes(x = x, y = y)) + geom_point() + labs(title = &amp;quot;This is a title&amp;quot;, subtitle = &amp;quot;This is a subtitle&amp;quot;) + annotate(&amp;quot;text&amp;quot;, x = 0, y = 0, label = &amp;quot;This is some text&amp;quot;, family = &amp;quot;Papyrus&amp;quot;, color = &amp;quot;darkred&amp;quot;, size = 8) + theme_light(base_family = &amp;quot;Comic Sans MS&amp;quot;) p But no‚Äî that was too easy.</description>
