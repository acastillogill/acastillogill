      <description>This year’s rOpenSci unconf was held in Seattle, and (after the great time I had at last year’s event), I was thrilled to be able to go back for more! All the fun, with like 40% less mind-crippling impostor-syndrome anxiety.1 😬
Once again, Sean Kross did a great job of rounding up the projects, complete with emoji annotations. 💥

I am decidedly a novice when it comes to any and all things Docker (which, incidentally, is why I’ve been reading these posts). But, since it’s helpful for me to have all of these resources together in one place, I thought I’d share the love around.1

      <description>On of the ways in which rOpenSci does such a stellar job of package “quality control” is through its open, peer-review onboarding process.
I had the chance to take part in this by reviewing Nicholas Tierney’s awesome visdat package 📦.
In what I’m told is an rOpenSci first, Nick and I both wrote up our experiences for the rOpenSci blog — giving you a peek into the reviewer and reviewee process.</description>

      <description>Meta lesson learned This is not the post I originally intended to write about the rOpenSci Unconf (and, I promise, this isn’t just a lame attempt to take the Magritte joke a step further). Rather, what follows is wisdom gleaned both at the unconf, and in in my (failed) attempts to write the aforementioned original post capturing my unconf experience.1
HUGOMORE42 In our two days of un-conferring, there were 20 packages written by ~70 participants.</description>
