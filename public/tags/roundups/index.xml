      <description>Thomas Lin Pedersen (known aliases: @thomasp85, data imaginist) has quite an array of cool packages, all of which you should check out. However, in celebration its CRANniversary 🎈 I thought ggraph deserved a roundup post of its own.1

I am decidedly a novice when it comes to any and all things Docker (which, incidentally, is why I’ve been reading these posts). But, since it’s helpful for me to have all of these resources together in one place, I thought I’d share the love around.1

I’ve loved blogdown 📦 for so long, that I was kind of shocked 😱 when I saw Yinui Xie’s post, Announcing blogdown: Create Websites with R Markdown, on the RStudio blog just last month!
Have people really been living without the magic ✨ of blogdown in their lives for so long?! If you are one of these people, then hopefully this post (which, yes, is really just a roundup of tweets) will inspire you to join in on the fun 👯.</description>

🎉🐱 purrr-tiest cheat sheet Purrr royal decree (ok, I’ll stop with the 🐱 puns now), the purrr 📦 now has its very own official RStudio cheat sheet: Apply Functions Cheat Sheet
 The purrr package makes it easy to work with lists and functions. This cheatsheet will remind you how to manipulate lists with purrr as well as how to apply functions iteratively to each element of a list or vector.</description>

      <description>Updated: 📆 2018-04-06.
Regular Expressions, RegEx, regexps– call them what you like, but no matter how you slice it, they’re useful af. After all, data spelunking is all about patterns, and that’s precisely what regexps are for: (wo)manhandling patterns in strings. Good Sirs Wickham and Grolemund, in their masterful tome, r4ds, describe them thusly:
 They [regexps] take a little while to get your head around, but once you understand them, you’ll find them extremely useful.</description>

      <description>I was excited to see Declutter your R workflow with tidy tools1, a preprint by Zev Ross, Hadley Wickham, and David Robinson, among the many excellent papers in the Practical Data Science for Stats PeerJ collection.2 Workflows, whether data-analysis-related or not, are never a one-size-fits-all matter of course. Among other things, the workflows here differ in scope (heck, one of them doesn’t even use R).
That said, there’s lots to be learned from the processes, mistakes, and hard-wrought wisdom 🦉 of others.</description>

      <title>tidyeval resource roundup</title>

Though, naturally, the Honorable Professor Doctor Sir Lord General Hadley Wickham’s Programming with dplyr article is the ne plus ultra of getting oneself aquainted with the latest and greatest in tidyeval programming recipes, quoting, and quasiquotation; there are some other resources out there.
After posting a link to Edwin Thoen’s ⭐️ Tidy evaluation, most common actions, I was asked if there were other tidyeval tutorials I knew of.</description>
