      <description>Preemptive peccavi This post is selfish. The following items are tips, only insofar as they are to my liking. What’s more, the material isn’t even original. I wrote these up in response to a thread on the RStudio Community site.1 So, consider yourselves warned. ☠️
 1. Put a bird on it. 🐦 Actually, not just a bird (damn my dedication to TV show references), I’d recommend having your twitter handle (if you’re on there) visible in writing.</description>

      <title>Updating your version of Hugo for blogdown on Netlify</title>

      <description>Fair warning ⚠️ All of the information that follows is indeed in blogdown: Creating Websites with R Markdown by Yihui Xie, Amber Thomas, and Alison Presmanes Hill. But, since this is the second time I got a bit lost in this process, I’m writing it up for my own (and anyone else’s incidental) edification.1
Plus, just look at all the failed deploys that happen when I mess it up…it renders my Netlify deploy panel hideous!</description>

I’ve loved blogdown 📦 for so long, that I was kind of shocked 😱 when I saw Yinui Xie’s post, Announcing blogdown: Create Websites with R Markdown, on the RStudio blog just last month!
Have people really been living without the magic ✨ of blogdown in their lives for so long?! If you are one of these people, then hopefully this post (which, yes, is really just a roundup of tweets) will inspire you to join in on the fun 👯.</description>

      <description>✂️ Snippets in RStudio As Sean Lopp describes in his super helpful post, RStudio IDE Easy Tricks You Might’ve Missed ⭐:
 Code snippets are a shortcut to insert common boilerplate code.
 You might also refer to them as “text macros”1— either way, they’re useful for speeding up the process of doing a thing in RStudio that you do frequently. In my case, this includes inserting “tweet chunks” in blogdown posts using a Hugo shortcode.</description>
