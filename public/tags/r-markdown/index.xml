      <description>Fair warning ‚ö†Ô∏è All of the information that follows is indeed in blogdown: Creating Websites with R Markdown by Yihui Xie, Amber Thomas, and Alison Presmanes Hill. But, since this is the second time I got a bit lost in this process, I‚Äôm writing it up for my own (and anyone else‚Äôs incidental) edification.1
Plus, just look at all the failed deploys that happen when I mess it up‚Ä¶it renders my Netlify deploy panel hideous!</description>

      <description>Updated: 2018-08-30
I‚Äôve loved blogdown üì¶ for so long, that I was kind of shocked üò± when I saw Yinui Xie‚Äôs post, Announcing blogdown: Create Websites with R Markdown, on the RStudio blog just last month!
Have people really been living without the magic ‚ú® of blogdown in their lives for so long?! If you are one of these people, then hopefully this post (which, yes, is really just a roundup of tweets) will inspire you to join in on the fun üëØ.</description>

      <description>‚úÇÔ∏è Snippets in RStudio As Sean Lopp describes in his super helpful post, RStudio IDE Easy Tricks You Might‚Äôve Missed ‚≠ê:
 Code snippets are a shortcut to insert common boilerplate code.
 You might also refer to them as ‚Äútext macros‚Äù1‚Äî either way, they‚Äôre useful for speeding up the process of doing a thing in RStudio that you do frequently. In my case, this includes inserting ‚Äútweet chunks‚Äù in blogdown posts using a Hugo shortcode.</description>
