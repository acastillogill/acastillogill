      <description>I’ve been able to answer quite a few of the questions that I asked before. For example, I don’t have to remove outliers because the algorithm is robust to outliers. No centering and scaling needs to be done to the variables. I can leave factors as factors, but the issue with with a lot of levels is that the tree can get quite wide which reduces its interpretability, which is after all, one of the advantages of using binary trees.</description>
