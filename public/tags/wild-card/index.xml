      <description>It’s not much in the way of a post, but (as tweeted earlier 👇), I’ve been digging refind of late.1
.@refindcom is pretty dope- all the 🔗s I tweet get stashed in my profile there, so, 👉👀 https://t.co/zfHl3cs31a
&amp;mdash; Mara Averick (@dataandme) October 11, 2017  Yes, it’s just another bookmarking tool— or discovery engine, or whatever it is the kids are calling things these days… The point is, it takes all the links from my tweets 🐦, and puts them in a much more browsable format.</description>

      <description>Over on the new RStudio Community site1, a useful thread arose re. asking questions ❓ on this new site vs. Stack Overflow: Choosing between this site and StackOverflow for posting a question. I won’t bother trying to recap the nuances of the discussion here (since you can go read it directly; see 🔗 above), but I wanted to stash a bit of info here from one of my responses that might be helpful to new coders and/or users of Stack Overflow (SO).</description>

      <description>I’ve always been a fan of marginalia.1 Likewise, I’ve been known to use a post-it or two (or five) from time to time. Why? Sometimes it’s just easier to communicate when you keep your visual options open.2
