      <description>Scenario 1: from spreadsheet to reprex So, you’ve been asked to make a reprex and you want to include a bit of data that you have in a spreadsheet.1 Meet {datapasta}, a package by Miles McBain that can make your life a whole lot easier. Once you’ve installed datapasta, you simply copy a selected number of rows from your spreadsheet (remember, this is a minimal reproducible example), and select the Paste as tribble option from the DATAPASTA section of the Addins dropdown.</description>

      <description>Jo-fai Chow’s rPlotter is described as “[w]rapper functions that make plotting in R a lot easier for beginners.” I came upon it in its best and highest form, though, as “another” colour-palette generator for R.1 To be specific, I was drawn in by Palette Tarantino, which you can catch the code for in Chow’s post, Towards (Yet) Another R Colour Palette Generator.

      <description>In honour of the triumphant return of reprex to CRAN, let’s revisit what I refer to as Jenny Bryan’s keys to reprex-cellence.1 The three keys are as follows:
code that actually runs
 code that I don’t have to run code that can be easily run2  Our example True to the ésprit de reprex, let’s look at a real world example to unpack why these attributes are so useful.</description>

      <description>😎 Summer of Data Science (#SoDS18) is upon us, and (thanks to Renée (aka @BecomingDataSci)) there is already some great guidance out there. I’m a big fan of “mini” projects — and, unlike Highlander, I’m pretty sure there can only be one isn’t the name of the SoDS game.
So, I wanted to share some ideas I have for potential micro-projects…

      <description>This year’s rOpenSci unconf was held in Seattle, and (after the great time I had at last year’s event), I was thrilled to be able to go back for more! All the fun, with like 40% less mind-crippling impostor-syndrome anxiety.1 😬
Once again, Sean Kross did a great job of rounding up the projects, complete with emoji annotations. 💥

The code itself (see RPub here) is a combination of Tidy time series Analysis with tibbletime by Matt Dancho, and How to Add a Logo to ggplot by Magick by Daniel P. Hadley (in which you’ll learn how to make a very awesome Vincent-Vega version of an mtcars scatter-plot, below).</description>

      <description>Preemptive peccavi This post is selfish. The following items are tips, only insofar as they are to my liking. What’s more, the material isn’t even original. I wrote these up in response to a thread on the RStudio Community site.1 So, consider yourselves warned. ☠️

      <description>Preamble Much of the code herein has been adapted from the excellent post “Where my girls at? Scraping Goodreads and using ML to estimate how many children’s books have a cetnral female character” by Giora Simchoni, which I highly recommend.
I’ll also make reference to my earlier post using my Goodreads data, should you want to check that out.
😱 Why aren’t you using the API?! Calm down! Yes, I know there is a perfectly lovely Goodreads API– and, by “perfectly lovely” I mean for getting pretty much any data other than book descriptions (which, as you will soon discover, are the objects of my desire).</description>

      <description>Why show us the wrong way? I know, this seems like a perverse manner of going about things, but these are ways of getting information that will help others to help you. This means that there’s a decent chance you’re new to this whole endeavor, and may need some stop-gap, familiar methods before you begin to feel comfortable with best practices.

Have people really been living without the magic ✨ of blogdown in their lives for so long?! If you are one of these people, then hopefully this post (which, yes, is really just a roundup of tweets) will inspire you to join in on the fun 👯.</description>

      <description>✂️ Snippets in RStudio As Sean Lopp describes in his super helpful post, RStudio IDE Easy Tricks You Might’ve Missed ⭐:
 Code snippets are a shortcut to insert common boilerplate code.
 You might also refer to them as “text macros”1— either way, they’re useful for speeding up the process of doing a thing in RStudio that you do frequently. In my case, this includes inserting “tweet chunks” in blogdown posts using a Hugo shortcode.</description>

      <description>Updated: 📆 2018-04-06.
Regular Expressions, RegEx, regexps– call them what you like, but no matter how you slice it, they’re useful af. After all, data spelunking is all about patterns, and that’s precisely what regexps are for: (wo)manhandling patterns in strings. Good Sirs Wickham and Grolemund, in their masterful tome, r4ds, describe them thusly:
 They [regexps] take a little while to get your head around, but once you understand them, you’ll find them extremely useful.</description>

      <description>I was excited to see Declutter your R workflow with tidy tools1, a preprint by Zev Ross, Hadley Wickham, and David Robinson, among the many excellent papers in the Practical Data Science for Stats PeerJ collection.2 Workflows, whether data-analysis-related or not, are never a one-size-fits-all matter of course. Among other things, the workflows here differ in scope (heck, one of them doesn’t even use R).
That said, there’s lots to be learned from the processes, mistakes, and hard-wrought wisdom 🦉 of others.</description>

Though, naturally, the Honorable Professor Doctor Sir Lord General Hadley Wickham’s Programming with dplyr article is the ne plus ultra of getting oneself aquainted with the latest and greatest in tidyeval programming recipes, quoting, and quasiquotation; there are some other resources out there.
After posting a link to Edwin Thoen’s ⭐️ Tidy evaluation, most common actions, I was asked if there were other tidyeval tutorials I knew of.</description>

      <description>On of the ways in which rOpenSci does such a stellar job of package “quality control” is through its open, peer-review onboarding process.
I had the chance to take part in this by reviewing Nicholas Tierney’s awesome visdat package 📦.

      <description>🤓 What is “normal” reading? There are very few things considered “normal” (in the “ordinary” sense of the word) about my reading habits. Let’s just say that, when I saw #BookLoversDay was trending on Twitter, my first thought was: it me! However, it also served as a reminder of my struggles regarding reading and “normalcy” of the Gaussian distribution variety.1
My beef is not with books themselves, but rather the limitations of rating them on Goodreads using a restrictive 5-star scale.</description>

Technically, it’s a keynote (🗝📝). But, since I’ve never even given a regular note, I can’t really say whether or not there will be more 🔑s involved than usual.1
Actual real adult data scientist, David Robinson (aka @drob), will also be keynoting,2 which means you should totally go.</description>
