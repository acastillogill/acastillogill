      <description>The goal of today’s session was to learn how to preprocess the homes dataset I’ve been working with. The missing values have been filled and now I have a few questions about whether I should perform or not, additional pre-processing steps before I can implement the CART algorithm.
 Should I remove highly correlated variables? I have three and I don’t know what to do with them? Should I remove levels within factor variables with few observations?</description>
