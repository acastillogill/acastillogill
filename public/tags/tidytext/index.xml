      <description>Preamble Much of the code herein has been adapted from the excellent post “Where my girls at? Scraping Goodreads and using ML to estimate how many children’s books have a cetnral female character” by Giora Simchoni, which I highly recommend.
I’ll also make reference to my earlier post using my Goodreads data, should you want to check that out.
😱 Why aren’t you using the API?! Calm down! Yes, I know there is a perfectly lovely Goodreads API– and, by “perfectly lovely” I mean for getting pretty much any data other than book descriptions (which, as you will soon discover, are the objects of my desire).</description>
