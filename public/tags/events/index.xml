      <description>🎉 I gave a talk at EARL Boston, and somehow managed not to die! 😵
Couldn’t make it? Here are the slides from the aforementioned, non-fatal event for your enjoyment. They likely won’t make too much sense on their own, and I plan on doing a proper write-up at some point. But, until that time comes…
 I’ve also put a high(er)-resolution version of these same slides (with working links 🔗) up at: https://bit.</description>

      <description>The rumors are true 😱 (ok, maybe there weren’t really any rumors), I’ll be speaking at the “Enterprise Applications of the R Language”, better known as EARL, conference in Boston. Technically, it’s a keynote (🗝📝). But, since I’ve never even given a regular note, I can’t really say whether or not there will be more 🔑s involved than usual.1
Actual real adult data scientist, David Robinson (aka @drob), will also be keynoting,2 which means you should totally go.</description>
