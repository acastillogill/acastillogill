      <description>Today I went to a poetry competition and heard a useful tip for memorising a poem, or in my case, speeches. Sometimes when we can’t memorise certain part of a text, after trying many times, maybe whatever is written down there, should go on the final version. Memorising can be a tool for editing the final text. When you read the text aloud, it’s own cadence and rhythm will point out that that word shouldn’t be there.</description>
