I find that the gender that requests the most loans is female with single females being the most frequent borrowers. The main uses for these loans are agriculture, retail, and food with some variations amongst regions. Half of the loans are 4.22 USD or less and are funded by 12 or less contributers. The median time between posting a loan online and disbursing it to the borrower is 16.89 days. I mainly use the tidyverse, stringr, and quantmode packages.","expirydate":-62135596800,"objectID":"41429b3fa65e9e188171ee8bdc0f02eb","permalink":"/2018/07/exploring-kiva-loans/","publishdate":"2018-07-07T00:00:00Z","summary":"1 Summary 2 Purpose of this post 3 The data 4 Data cleaning 5 Exploratory data analysis 6 Techniques used 7 Questions from this analysis   1 Summary To see the code used in this post, visit my kernel on kaggle in R Markdown format.\nIn this post I analyse 671,205 Kiva loans.
