I find that single female is the gender that requests the most loans. The main uses for Kiva loans are agriculture, retail, and food with some variations amongst regions. Half of the loans are 4.22 USD or less and are funded by 12 or less contributers. The median time between posting on the Kiva platform and disbursing it to the borrower is 16.89 days. I mainly use the tidyverse, stringr, and quantmode packages.","expirydate":-62135596800,"objectID":"41429b3fa65e9e188171ee8bdc0f02eb","permalink":"/2018/07/exploring-kiva-loans/","publishdate":"2018-07-07T00:00:00Z","summary":"1 Summary 2 Purpose of this post 3 The data 4 Data cleaning 5 Exploratory data analysis 5.1 Borrower gender by region 5.2 Repayment interval by region 5.3 Loan use by region  6 Techniques used 7 Questions from this analysis   1 Summary To see the code used in this post, visit my kernel on kaggle in R Markdown format.\nIn this post I analyse 671,205 Kiva loans from around the world.","tags":["Kaggle","Kiva","End-to-end","Exploratory data analysis"],"title":"Exploring Kiva loans"},{"categories":[],"date":1533772800,"description":"In this post I explore a property dataset from Ames, Iowa.

Unsurprisingly, I found that large countries have the most total downloads. I then decide to explore downloads per capita and find that small, developed countries around the world have the most downloads. Finally, I look into which the times of the year are most common for downloading R.
