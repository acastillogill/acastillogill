      <description>Scenario 1: from spreadsheet to reprex So, you’ve been asked to make a reprex and you want to include a bit of data that you have in a spreadsheet.1 Meet {datapasta}, a package by Miles McBain that can make your life a whole lot easier. Once you’ve installed datapasta, you simply copy a selected number of rows from your spreadsheet (remember, this is a minimal reproducible example), and select the Paste as tribble option from the DATAPASTA section of the Addins dropdown.</description>

      <description>Jo-fai Chow’s rPlotter is described as “[w]rapper functions that make plotting in R a lot easier for beginners.” I came upon it in its best and highest form, though, as “another” colour-palette generator for R.1 To be specific, I was drawn in by Palette Tarantino, which you can catch the code for in Chow’s post, Towards (Yet) Another R Colour Palette Generator.

      <description>In honour of the triumphant return of reprex to CRAN, let’s revisit what I refer to as Jenny Bryan’s keys to reprex-cellence.1 The three keys are as follows:
code that actually runs
 code that I don’t have to run code that can be easily run2  Our example True to the ésprit de reprex, let’s look at a real world example to unpack why these attributes are so useful.</description>

      <description>😎 Summer of Data Science (#SoDS18) is upon us, and (thanks to Renée (aka @BecomingDataSci)) there is already some great guidance out there. I’m a big fan of “mini” projects — and, unlike Highlander, I’m pretty sure there can only be one isn’t the name of the SoDS game.
So, I wanted to share some ideas I have for potential micro-projects…

      <description>There is a relationship between war (and death) and counting things.1 Some of the best known data visualizations pertain to the casualties of war (e.g. Florence Nightingale’s coxcomb chart, Diagram of the Causes of Mortality, 1858).
When I came upon Lt. Colonel Albert G. Love’s 1931 “War Casualties”2 my curiosity was piqued. Focused on “the World War” (at that date there had only been one), Colonel Love describes his task in the preface:</description>

      <description>Inspired by Laura Ellis (aka @LittleMissData’s) post, Data Storytelling, I decided to take Flourish for a spin to look at NBA-team win percentages over the course of the season thus far. 🏀
As advertised, Flourish is a tool for “powerful, beautiful, easy data visualisation” that lets you “quickly turn your spreadsheets into stunning online charts, maps and interactive stories.” Clearly someone on the Flourish team and I are on the same wavelength when it comes to carnival games and data visualization, since the animated rank or relative-score chart that caught my eye turned out to be named the Horserace template.</description>

      <description>In my personal going-on-a-podcast debut, I chatted with Hugo Bowne-Anderson for the DataCamp podcast, DataFramed. Hugo must be an amazing editor, because it even makes sense!
The episode, Data Nerdism at Large (with Mara Averick), is up on their site, along with links to some of the topics that came up. Since Hugo’s good at this stuff, I’ll just steal his blurb:
 Mara Averick, self-labelled data nerd and Tidyverse developer advocate at RStudio, speaks with Hugo about all things data: what it means to be a data nerd and how data science impacts all of our lives from thinking about toxicology to sports analytics to data for social good and civic tech.</description>

      <description>Ever the acolyte of Jenny Bryan when it comes to all things workflow, I try to follow Happy Git and GitHub for the useR as much as possible.
I’ve never been especially good at Git, per se, but the shell met my needs for a long time…a long time, that is, before I started working with a team that really uses GitHub for version control.
So, I decided to give Sourcetree a whirl.</description>

      <description>I came upon a post by Andrew Heiss, Working with R, Cairo graphics, custom fonts, and ggplot, and couldn’t help but notice that the featured font was one I’d seen before…

I thought I could forget about it— move on with my life. Maybe I could just load the tidyverse, recreate Andrew’s plot, and be done with the whole thing.

😱 Why aren’t you using the API?! Calm down! Yes, I know there is a perfectly lovely Goodreads API– and, by “perfectly lovely” I mean for getting pretty much any data other than book descriptions (which, as you will soon discover, are the objects of my desire).</description>

 Code snippets are a shortcut to insert common boilerplate code.

Regular Expressions, RegEx, regexps– call them what you like, but no matter how you slice it, they’re useful af. After all, data spelunking is all about patterns, and that’s precisely what regexps are for: (wo)manhandling patterns in strings. Good Sirs Wickham and Grolemund, in their masterful tome, r4ds, describe them thusly:
 They [regexps] take a little while to get your head around, but once you understand them, you’ll find them extremely useful.</description>

      <description>I was excited to see Declutter your R workflow with tidy tools1, a preprint by Zev Ross, Hadley Wickham, and David Robinson, among the many excellent papers in the Practical Data Science for Stats PeerJ collection.2 Workflows, whether data-analysis-related or not, are never a one-size-fits-all matter of course. Among other things, the workflows here differ in scope (heck, one of them doesn’t even use R).
That said, there’s lots to be learned from the processes, mistakes, and hard-wrought wisdom 🦉 of others.</description>

Though, naturally, the Honorable Professor Doctor Sir Lord General Hadley Wickham’s Programming with dplyr article is the ne plus ultra of getting oneself aquainted with the latest and greatest in tidyeval programming recipes, quoting, and quasiquotation; there are some other resources out there.
After posting a link to Edwin Thoen’s ⭐️ Tidy evaluation, most common actions, I was asked if there were other tidyeval tutorials I knew of.</description>

      <title>Onboarding with rOpenSci: Tandem tales of package review</title>

      <description>On of the ways in which rOpenSci does such a stellar job of package “quality control” is through its open, peer-review onboarding process.
I had the chance to take part in this by reviewing Nicholas Tierney’s awesome visdat package 📦.
In what I’m told is an rOpenSci first, Nick and I both wrote up our experiences for the rOpenSci blog — giving you a peek into the reviewer and reviewee process.</description>

      <description>So, kinda the whole point of this “making-a-blog” endeavor (aside from getting to play with Yihui Xie’s super awesome blogdown 📦) was to give a more permanent home to some of the resources I’ve found and/or tweeted. So, without further ado…
stringr «aide-mémoire» This visual guide (or cheat sheet, if you prefer) was made by Lise Vaudor (@LVaudor on twitter), and originally shared in her blog post, Manipuler des strings avec R.</description>

      <description>I’ve always been a fan of marginalia.1 Likewise, I’ve been known to use a post-it or two (or five) from time to time. Why? Sometimes it’s just easier to communicate when you keep your visual options open.2
Such was the case the other day, when I had a question about how best to approach a problem in GitHub. (I’m not going to explain it in words, because it’s hard, and I’m lazy, and that’s how I ended up here in the first place!</description>

      <description>🤓 What is “normal” reading? There are very few things considered “normal” (in the “ordinary” sense of the word) about my reading habits. Let’s just say that, when I saw #BookLoversDay was trending on Twitter, my first thought was: it me! However, it also served as a reminder of my struggles regarding reading and “normalcy” of the Gaussian distribution variety.1
My beef is not with books themselves, but rather the limitations of rating them on Goodreads using a restrictive 5-star scale.</description>

      <description>The rumors are true 😱 (ok, maybe there weren’t really any rumors), I’ll be speaking at the “Enterprise Applications of the R Language”, better known as EARL, conference in Boston. Technically, it’s a keynote (🗝📝). But, since I’ve never even given a regular note, I can’t really say whether or not there will be more 🔑s involved than usual.1
Actual real adult data scientist, David Robinson (aka @drob), will also be keynoting,2 which means you should totally go.</description>

      <description>When I found out that Amelia McNamara and Aran Lunzer were about to release their extremely awesome, interactive essay on histograms, I was quick to offer my advice in my true area of expertise: making GIFs out of video for the internet. Amelia found my infinite wisdom to be helpful, and suggested that I do a blog post about it.1 And so, here we are…
Big picture: I read a cool post by Christopher J.</description>

      <description>Meta lesson learned This is not the post I originally intended to write about the rOpenSci Unconf (and, I promise, this isn’t just a lame attempt to take the Magritte joke a step further). Rather, what follows is wisdom gleaned both at the unconf, and in in my (failed) attempts to write the aforementioned original post capturing my unconf experience.1
HUGOMORE42 In our two days of un-conferring, there were 20 packages written by ~70 participants.</description>
