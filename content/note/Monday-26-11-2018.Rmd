So today I described the tree and it's results and I realised to some extent that my binning of the `Neighborhood` variable is definitely wrong. I had binned it as a function of `SalePrice` removing the names of the neighborhoods that contained some important information such as location.

I will fix that tomorrow, plus write the summary. Then on Wednesday I plan to proofread and leave it as is and hopefully at the end of this week start the next post on k-means clustering which is way overdue.
