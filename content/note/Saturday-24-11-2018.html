<h2>Goal 1: Edit the final blogpost.</h2>
<p>So today I’ve had a session of ruthlessly cutting out a lot of the things I had written and I guess, a lot of the work I had done. In the end the most important thing is to make a much more readable blogpost that goes to the point. When I started writing that blogpost, I hadn’t really started this daily journal to think out loud about I was doing. Today I made a lot of changes.</p>
<p>I still have to write the interpretation, the summary, final proofing, and then upload to Kaggle.</p>
