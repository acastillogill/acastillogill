<div id="daily-goals" class="section level1">
<h1>Daily goals:</h1>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Continue editing the daily goal.</li>

<h2>Goal 1: 1. Continue editing the daily goal.</h2>
<p>So today I described the tree and it’s results and I realised to some extent that my binning of the <code>Neighborhood</code> variable is definitely wrong. I had binned it as a function of <code>SalePrice</code> removing the names of the neighborhoods that contained some important information such as location.</p>
<p>I will fix that tomorrow, plus write the summary. Then on Wednesday I plan to proofread and leave it as is and hopefully at the end of this week start the next post on k-means clustering which is way overdue.</p>
