# Goal's for today's session are:

1. Understand what information is the `neighboorhood` variable providing

2. Create a new variable that captures what the variable is providing without so many levels. 

## Goal 1: Understand what information is the `neighboorhood` variable providing


```{r, echo=TRUE, eval=FALSE}
levels(homes$Neighborhood)
```

Shows that the variable has 25 levels. Let's see the relationship between each level and the response variable `SalesPrice`.

Plotting the `neighboorhood` variable shows:

## Goal 2: Create a new variable that captures what the variable is providing without so many levels. 

Let's say we want to create a variable with four levels, these would be the quantile cuts:

```{r echo=TRUE, eval=FALSE}
    0%    25%    50%    75%   100% 
 34900 129975 163000 214000 755000 
```

 
This shows for example that only very few neighborhoods will be in the last quantile (above `$755,000`).

Tomorrow I will do the rest cause right now I gotta go.
