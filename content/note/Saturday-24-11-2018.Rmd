# Daily goals:

1. Edit the final blogpost.

## Goal 1: Edit the final blogpost.

```{r read data, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
library(rpart)
library(rpart.plot)
library(knitr)
options(digits=4)
options(scipen = 999)
opts_chunk$set(echo = FALSE,
               warning = FALSE,
               error = FALSE,
               message = FALSE,
               collapse= TRUE,
               comment = NA,
               tidy = TRUE)
theme_set(theme_light())
homes <- readRDS(file=here::here("data","homes.rds"))
```

So today I've had a session of ruthlessly cutting out a lot of the things I had written and I guess, a lot of the work I had done. In the end the most important thing is to make a much more readable blogpost that goes to the point. When I started writing that blogpost, I hadn't really started this daily journal to think out loud about I was doing. Today I made a lot of changes.

I still have to write the interpretation, the summary, final proofing, and then upload to Kaggle.
