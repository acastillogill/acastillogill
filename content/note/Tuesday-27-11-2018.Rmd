# Daily goals:

1. Bin the neighbhorhood variable properly. 

## Goal 1: Bin the neighborhood variable properly.

```{r read data, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
library(rpart)
library(rpart.plot)
library(knitr)
options(digits=4)
options(scipen = 999)
opts_chunk$set(echo = FALSE,
               warning = FALSE,
               error = FALSE,
               message = FALSE,
               collapse= TRUE,
               comment = NA,
               tidy = TRUE)
theme_set(theme_light())
homes <- readRDS(file=here::here("static","data","homes.rds"))

```

So job done than on that part. Now all I have to do it seems is write up the summary and then proofread. Let me see the whole thing again and decide.
