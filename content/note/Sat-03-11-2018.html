<p>The goal of today’s session was to learn how to preprocess the homes dataset I’ve been working with. The missing values have been filled and now I have a few questions about whether I should perform or not, additional pre-processing steps before I can implement the CART algorithm.</p>
<ul>
<li>Should I remove highly correlated variables? I have three and I don’t know what to do with them?</li>
<li>Should I remove levels within factor variables with few observations?</li>
<li>Should I bin variables with lots of factors like neighboorhoods?</li>
<li>Should I bin numeric variables that related to the same metric? (i.e. square feet)</li>
<li>What about outliers?</li>
</ul>
<p>So for now I’m reading the introduction to <a href="https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/rpart/vignettes/longintro.pdf">Recursive Partioning document that comes with the R Part package</a>.</p>
<p>I am also trying to figure out what constitutes improvements in the branch-splitting algorithm to know why it stops when it does.</p>
