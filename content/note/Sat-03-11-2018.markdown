The goal of today's session was to learn how to preprocess the homes dataset I've been working with. The missing values have been filled and now I have a few questions about whether I should perform or not, additional pre-processing steps before I can implement the CART algorithm.

- Should I remove highly correlated variables? I have three and I don't know what to do with them?
- Should I remove levels within factor variables with few observations?
- Should I bin variables with lots of factors like neighboorhoods?
- Should I bin numeric variables that related to the same metric? (i.e. square feet)
- What about outliers? 

So for now I'm reading the introduction to [Recursive Partioning document that comes with the R Part package](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/rpart/vignettes/longintro.pdf). 

I am also trying to figure out what constitutes improvements in the branch-splitting algorithm to know why it stops when it does.
