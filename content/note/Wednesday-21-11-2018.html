<div id="goals-for-todays-session-are" class="section level1">
<h1>Goal’s for today’s session are:</h1>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Figure out why the <code>RMSE</code> and <code>MSE</code> went up when I chose an “improved” tree.</li>
</ol>
<div id="goal-1-figure-out-why-the-rmse-and-mse-went-up-when-i-chose-an-improved-tree." class="section level2">
<h2>Goal 1: Figure out why the <code>RMSE</code> and <code>MSE</code> went up when I chose an “improved” tree.</h2>
<p>The <code>rmse</code> for the base model <code>homes_model</code> is 36182.1117 and the <code>mae</code> is 25797.5518.</p>
<p>The <code>rmse</code> for the improved model <code>homes_model_opt</code> is 40848.44 and the <code>mae</code> is 28394.1.</p>
<p>This shouldn’t be the case, or should it?</p>
<p>Let’s think what an increase in these two types of performance metrics mean. In the <code>rmse</code> case, yesterday we saw that this is a measure of how much the fit deviates from real values.
An increase of 4666.3268 means that the pruned model is a worse fit. WHY? Shouldn’t a smaller tree prevent overfitting?</p>
<p>I’ve just posted the question on Stack Overflow because right now I don’t have any ideas… maybe there is nothing wrong with performance metrics going up? But that doesn’t make sense. Wasn’t the whole process of choosing the best <code>cp_index</code> to choose a tree with improved performance?</p>
<p>I am very confused. It doesn’t make sense. I am going to look at the documentation again to see if I can find anything on performance metrics.</p>
