<h1>Goal’s for today’s session are:</h1>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Figure out why the <code>RMSE</code> and <code>MSE</code> went up when I chose an “improved” tree.</li>

<h2>Goal 1: Figure out why the <code>RMSE</code> and <code>MSE</code> went up when I chose an “improved” tree.</h2>
<p>The <code>rmse</code> for the base model <code>homes_model</code> is 46893.56 and the <code>mae</code> is 31678.89.</p>
<p>The <code>rmse</code> for the improved model <code>homes_model_opt</code> is 49963.95 and the <code>mae</code> is 33909.8.</p>
<p>This shouldn’t be the case, or should it?</p>
<p>Let’s think what an increase in these two types of performance metrics mean. In the <code>rmse</code> case, yesterday we saw that this is a measure of how much the fit deviates from real values.
An increase of 3070.39 means that the pruned model is a worse fit. WHY? Shouldn’t a smaller tree prevent overfitting?</p>
