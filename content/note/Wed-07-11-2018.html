<p>According to user Harold Ship in <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/29197213/what-is-the-difference-between-rel-error-and-x-error-in-a-rpart-decision-tree">this post</a>, we should pick the tree with that keeps this relationship but has the tallest (that’s what he means with the lowest level, since each row represents a tree with more splits):</p>
<p><span class="math inline">\(rel\&gt;error\)</span> <span class="math inline">\(+\)</span> <span class="math inline">\(xstd\)</span> <span class="math inline">\(&lt;\)</span> <span class="math inline">\(xerror\)</span></p>
