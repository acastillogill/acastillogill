<p>Today is Sunday, rest day. I went to a poetry competition and heard a useful tip for memorising a poem, or in my case, speeches. Sometimes when we can’t memorise certain part of a text, after trying many times, maybe whatever is written down there, should go on the final version. Memorising can be a tool for editing the final text. When you read the text aloud, it’s own cadence and rhythm will point out that that word shouldn’t be there.</p>
<p>I’ve joined the local chapter of Toastmasters and this recently happened to me with a speech. There were two lines in the third paragraph that I just couldn’t remember. After trying to memorise them over and over, I realised that actually the bit I was struggling with could have been said in another way. In a way that was more memorable for the audience and that made more sense within the text. Changed it and voila! Same idea expressed differently and it was easy to memorise and it made a bigger impact.</p>
