# Summary

In this post I share how I spent my time during my data scientist job search. I then use this information to point out things I would have done differently and things I'm glad I did. The content of this blogpost was first presented at R-Ladies London on 2019-02-21 with [these slides](https://acastillogill.com/slides/2019-02-21-r-ladies-data-science-interviews-presentation.html#1):
