# Question

What countries download R the most? Where are they? And who are the most *intense* R users measured by R downloads per capita?
Which months of the year are the most popular times to download R? Does it depend on the season? What variable could we attempt to use as a predictor of R downloads? Could we use linear regression for inference?

# Dataset description 

I used the [Tidy Tuesday dataset](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/tree/master/data/2018-10-30) for R Downloads posted on 30th October 2018. 

The dataset contained 938,115 observations and eight features corresponding to a unique id, download date, time, size, version, os, country, and IP id. The downloads correspond to a year's worth of downloads running from 2017-10-20 to 2018-10-20. To prevent any overlap and have one entire year, I limited downloads until 2018-10-19. After I removed missing values, there were `r nrow(r_downloads)` observations.



## Total R Downloads

So what are the top ten countries with the most downloads? 

```{r read-country-codes-and-pop-and-map}
iso_codes <- read_csv(here::here("static","data","iso_countries.csv"))

pop <-read_csv(here::here("static","data","country_populations.csv"))

map_path <- here::here("static","data","world_shapefile","world_shapefile.shp")
world <- sf::st_read(map_path)

```

```{r merge-country-codes}
r_downloads%<>%
  full_join(iso_codes, by=c("country"="iso"))%>%
  filter(!is.na(sub_region))
```

```{r downloads-by-country}
r_downloads%>%
  group_by(name)%>%
  summarise(n=n())%>%
  filter(!is.na(n))%>%
  arrange(desc(n))->downloads_per_country
```



```{r plot-top-10-countries, fig.cap="The US has almost six times as many downloads than the second country China.", include=TRUE}
downloads_per_country%>%
  arrange(desc(n))%>%
  head(10)%>%
  mutate(name=fct_reorder(name,n))%>%
  ggplot(aes(name,n,fill=name))+
  geom_col()+
  expand_limits(y=0)+
  coord_flip()+
  scale_y_continuous(labels=comma_format())+
  labs(title="Top 10 countries by R downloads in 2017/18",
       x="",
       y="Downloads")+
  theme(legend.position = "none")
  
```

```{r create-tibble-with-pop-and-users-only}
full_maps <- downloads_per_country%>%
  full_join(iso_codes, by=c("name"="name"))%>%
  filter(!is.na(sub_region))%>%
  left_join(pop, by=c("name"="name"))%>%
  select(n, name, iso_3, region, sub_region, pop_2018)%>%
  mutate(n_capita=n/pop_2018)%>%
  filter(!is.na(n_capita),
         pop_2018!=0)
```

```{r merge-full-maps-and-map-path}
world_full <- world%>%
  left_join(full_maps, by=c("ISO3"="iso_3"))
```

```{r create-total-downloads-map}
n_map <- tm_shape(world_full) + 
  tm_borders(col="black", lwd=0.1)+
    tm_fill(col="n",n=4, style="jenks", palette = get_brewer_pal("BuPu", n = 4, contrast = c(0.13, 0.9))) + 
tm_layout(main.title = "Total R downloads in 2017/18",
          main.title.size = 2, frame = TRUE, bg.color = "aliceblue", title.position = c("right","bottom"))+
tm_legend(position=c("left", "bottom"), bg.color="white", frame=TRUE, legend.title.size=1)
```
And what about other countries and regions?
```{r plot-total-downloads-map, include=TRUE, fig.cap="Besides the US, China, Germany, and other countries featured in the top 10, the map allows us to see which countries in each country downloaded R the most. These are Colombia and Brazil in South America; Mexico in Central America; and Italy, France and Poland in Europe."}
n_map
```

## Total R Downloads per capita

Some countries are heavier R users measured by the number of downloads per capita. I wanted to see how this compared with total downloads. 

```{r plot-top-10-countries-per-capita, fig.cap="Hong Kong, Switzerland, and Iceland, had more than two downloads per capita during the 2017/18 period.", include=TRUE}
full_maps%>%
  arrange(desc(n_capita))%>%
  head(10)%>%
  mutate(name=fct_reorder(name,n_capita))%>%
  ggplot(aes(name,n_capita,fill=name))+
  geom_col()+
  expand_limits(y=0)+
  coord_flip()+
  scale_y_continuous(labels=comma_format())+
  labs(title="Top 10 countries by R downloads per capita in 2017/18",
       x="",
       y="Downloads")+
  theme(legend.position = "none")
  
```

And again, how does this look like around the world?

```{r create-downloads-per-capita-map}
n_capita_map <- tm_shape(world_full) + 
  tm_borders(col="black", lwd=0.1)+
    tm_fill(col="n_capita",n=4, style="jenks", palette = get_brewer_pal("OrRd", n = 4, contrast = c(0.13, 0.9))) + 
tm_layout(main.title = "R downloads per capita in 2017/18",
          main.title.size = 2, frame = TRUE, bg.color = "aliceblue", title.position = c("right","bottom"))+
tm_legend(position=c("left", "bottom"), bg.color="white", frame=TRUE, legend.title.size=1)
```

```{r plot-downloads-per-capita-map, include=TRUE, fig.cap="Besides the top 10 downloads per capita plot, here we see that Uruguay and Chile in South America have the most downloads per capita; El Salvador in Central America; and Japan in Asia."}
n_capita_map
```


## Times of the year with most downloads

I wonder at what times in the year are most popular for R downloads. Does it change amongst regions?

```{r create-r-downloads-per-region}
monthly_downloads_per_region <- r_downloads%>%
#Group by the month of the year
 group_by(month(date), sub_region)%>%
#Count downloads by the month of the year
summarise(monthly_downloads=n())%>%
#Pipe to make a plot
ggplot(aes(x=`month(date)`,y= monthly_downloads))+
#Add line
geom_line(alpha=0.5, color="coral2")+
geom_point(color="coral2")+
scale_x_continuous(breaks=c(seq(1,12,1)))+
#Add nice commas y axis
scale_y_continuous(labels=comma_format())+
 #Add title
labs(title="Monthly R downloads around the world",
y="Downloads",
x="Week")+
facet_wrap(~sub_region, scales="free")
```

```{r plot-monthly-downloads-per-region}
monthly_downloads_per_region 
```
