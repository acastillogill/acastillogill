# Question

In a [previous post](https://acastillogill.com/2018/11/r-downloads-around-the-world/) I had looked at which countries downloaded R the most. That led me to ask which countries were the most intense R users, using downloads per 1,000 capita as a proxy. 

When I was writing the conclusions about the most R-using countries, I tried to draw up patterns. What did those R-using countries have in common? They were mostly "developed" countries. Since developed countries tend to have high levels of academic attainment, I decided to explore the relationship between education levels and R-usage across the globe:  

**How does the education index relate to R downloads per 1,000 capita?** 

To answer my question, I identified a metric that would allow me to explore the relationship between education and R usage. That metric turned out to be the UN's education index, which I will explain below. 

# Dataset description 

I used the [Tidy Tuesday dataset](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/tree/master/data/2018-10-30) for R downloads posted on 30th October 2018. The dataset contained 938,115 observations and eight features corresponding to a unique id, download date, time, size, version, os, country, and IP id. The downloads correspond to a year's worth of downloads running from 2017-10-20 to 2018-10-20. To prevent any overlap and have one entire year, I limited downloads to 2018-10-19. After I removed missing values, there were `r nrow(r_downloads)` observations.

For the independent variable, I downloaded the education index for all countries. The education index is a metric published by the United Nations and it corresponds to the average of the Mean Years of Schooling Index (MYSI) and the Expected Years of Schooling Index (EYSI): 

$$EI={\frac {{\textrm {MYSI}}+{\textrm {EYSI}}}{2}}$$

```{r read-data}
iso_codes <- read_csv(here::here("static","data","iso_countries.csv"))

pop <-read_csv(here::here("static","data","country_populations.csv"))

map_path <- here::here("static","data","world_shapefile","world_shapefile.shp")
world <- sf::st_read(map_path)

educ <- read_csv(here::here("static","data","edu_year.csv"))

educ$edu_index <- as.double(educ$edu_index)

```

```{r merge-country-codes}
r_downloads%<>%
  full_join(iso_codes, by=c("country"="iso"))%>%
  filter(!is.na(sub_region))
```

```{r downloads-by-country}
r_downloads%>%
  group_by(name)%>%
  summarise(n=n())%>%
  filter(!is.na(n))%>%
  arrange(desc(n))->downloads_per_country
```
# The relationship between the education index and R downloads

```{r create-tibble-with-pop-and-users-only}
full_maps <- downloads_per_country%>%
  full_join(iso_codes, by=c("name"="name"))%>%
  filter(!is.na(sub_region))%>%
  left_join(pop, by=c("name"="name"))%>%
  select(n, name, iso_3, region, sub_region, pop_2018)%>%
  mutate(n_capita=n/pop_2018)%>%
  filter(!is.na(n_capita),
         pop_2018!=0)
```

```{r merge-years-of-education}

full_maps_edu <- full_maps%>%
  left_join(educ, by="name")%>%
  mutate(edu_index_percent=edu_index*100)%>%
  na.omit()

```

```{r plot-relationship-between-educ-and-n-capita, fig.height=7,fig.cap="There appears to be an exponential relationship between the education index and the number of R downloads per 1,000 capita."}
ggplot(full_maps_edu, aes(x=edu_index_percent, y=n_capita))+
  geom_point(alpha=0.5)+
  labs(title="The education index vs. R downloads per 1,000 capita",
       x="Education index",
       y="R downloads per 1,000 capita")+
  geom_text_repel(aes(label=name), force=0.2, size=2, segment.alpha = 0.5)
```

```{r plot-relationship-between-educ-and-n-capita-log,include=TRUE, fig.height=10,fig.cap="When I plotted the education index vs. R downloads per 1,000 capita, I noticed exponential behaviour in the y-axis. Since I planned to use a linear regression, I took the logarithm of the response variable. The figure shows that by taking the logarithm of R downloads per 1,000 capita, we have met the criteria for a linear regression."}
ggplot(full_maps_edu, aes(x=edu_index_percent, y=log(n_capita)))+
  geom_point(alpha=0.5)+
  geom_smooth(method="lm", color="salmon", se=FALSE, size=2, alpha=0.5)+
  geom_text_repel(aes(label=name), force=0.2, size=2, segment.alpha = 0.5)+
  labs(title="The Education Index vs. R Downloads per 1,000 capita",
       x="Education index",
       y="R downloads per 1,000 capita (logarithm applied)")
```

The relationship between the two variables is linear now - time for a linear regression!

That will take the form:

$$ln(downloads\space per \space 1,000 \space capita)=\beta_0+\beta_1*Education\space index + \varepsilon$$

The F-Statistics will be testing:

$$ H_0: \beta_1=0$$
$$ H_A: \beta_1\neq 0$$

```{r create-model-of-educ-r-capita, include=TRUE}
fit <- lm( log(n_capita) ~ edu_index_percent, data = full_maps_edu)
fit%>%
  tidy()%>%
  kable()
f_statistic <- summary(fit)$fstatistic
p_value_f_statistic <- pf(f_statistic[1],f_statistic[2],f_statistic[3],lower.tail = FALSE)
```

After checking out the residuals, I saw there are a few outliers, mainly Turkmenistan, Tajikistan, Libya, Burkina Faso, and Chad. I decided to leave them in because it's interesting to think about what specific characteristcs contribute to them being be under or over the trend line. The model I proposed, explains `r summary(fit)$adj.r.squared*100` of the variation in the data. It's not a lot but it's also not insignificant. After having tried to fit a multiple linear regression model with other variables such as GDP and life expectancy, I found the education index to be the best predictor of R downloads per 1,000 capita. 

```{r remove-outliers}
outliers <- c(160,148,140,95,162)

full_maps_edu_sans_outliers <- full_maps_edu[-outliers,]

fit_2 <- lm( log(n_capita) ~ edu_index_percent, data = full_maps_edu_sans_outliers)
summary(fit_2)
plot(fit_2)
```

```{r nesting-models}

full_maps_edu %>%
  group_by(region) %>%
  
  #Nest models
  nest() %>%

#Create linear regression

  mutate(model = map(data,~lm(formula=log(n_capita) ~ edu_index, data=.x))) %>%
  

#Metrics of all models
  
  mutate(coef = map(model,~glance(.x))) %>%
  
#Models  
  unnest(coef) %>%
  
  select(region, adj.r.squared) %>%
  kable()

```

```{r plot-relationship-between-educ-and-n-capita-log-regions, fig.cap="Seems that the relationship is less strong when the data is separated into regions."}
ggplot(full_maps_edu, aes(x = edu_index, y = log(n_capita)))+
  geom_point(alpha = 0.5) +
  geom_smooth(method="lm", color="salmon", se=FALSE, size=2, alpha = 0.5) +
  labs(title ="The education index vs. R downloads per 1,000 capita by region",
       x="Education index",
       y="R downloads per 1,000 capita (logarithm applied)")+
  facet_wrap(.~region, scales="free")
```

# Results

- Based on the model:

$ln(downloads\space per \space 1,000 \space capita)=-9.9203 +0.1034*Education\space index + \varepsilon$

and the F-Statistic with p-value `r p_value_f_statistic`, we can reject $H_0$ and say that there is a relationship between the education index and R Downloads per 1,000 capita.

- The education index explains `r  summary(fit)$adj.r.squared*100` percent of the variation in R Downloads per 1,000 capita around the world. 

- The geometric mean of R downloads per 1,000 capita is `r exp(summary(fit)$coef[1])`.

- A one unit increase in the education index, is expected to increase on average, R downloads per 1,000 capita by a factor of 1.109:

$$log(Education\space index\space +1) - log(Education\space index)=0.1034$$

$$log({\frac{Education\space index\space +1}{Education\space index}})=0.1034$$

$$e^{log({\frac{Education\space index\space +1}{Education\space index}})}=e^{0.1034}$$
$$\frac{Education\space index\space +1}{Education\space index}=1.109$$


Now, if we wanted to create a confidence interval:

$$P (e^{lower\space bound}<\frac{Education\space index\space +1}{Education\space index}<e^{upper\space bound})=0.95$$
The $lower\space bound$ is $point\space estimate-2*SE=0.1034-2*0.0059=$ and the $upper\space bound$ is $point\space estimate+2*SE=0.1034+2*0.0059=0.1152$, 

$$P (e^{0.0916}<\frac{Education\space index\space +1}{Education\space index}<e^{0.1152})=0.95$$
$$P (1.096<\frac{Education\space index\space +1}{Education\space index}<1.122)=0.95$$

We can see this increase by plotting the fitted values:

```{r plot-fitted-values,include=TRUE, fig.height=7}

fit %>%
  augment() %>%
  ggplot(aes (x = edu_index_percent, y = exp(.fitted)))+
  geom_point(alpha=0.5, color="red")+
  geom_point(data=full_maps_edu,aes(x= edu_index_percent, y= n_capita),alpha=0.5)+
  labs(title= "The Education Index vs. R Downloads per 1,000 capita",
       subtitle="Black dots are real values and red dots are fitted values. For every percentage point \nincrease in the education index, the geometric mean of R downloads per 1,000 capita is \nexpected to increase, on average, by 10.9%. Also, ",
       x = "Education index",
       y = "R downloads per 1,000 capita") +
  expand_limits(0,0)
```

# Conclusion

In this blog post, I set out to explain the relationship between the education index and R downloads per 1,000 capita across the globe. To do this, I identified an education based metric for all countries. I then regressed R downloads per 1,000 capita onto the education index. I found that the education index (values from 2016) explains about `r  summary(fit)$adj.r.squared*100` of variation in R downloads per 1,000 capita. There were several outliers including Turkmenistan, Tajikistan, Libya, Burkina Faso, and Chad.
