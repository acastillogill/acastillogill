# Summary

In this post I share how I spent my time during my data scientist job search. I then use this information to point out things I would have done differently and things I'm glad I did. The content of this blogpost was first presented at R-Ladies London on 2019-02-21 and the presentation is [here](https://acastillogill.com/slides/2019-02-21-r-ladies-data-science-interviews-presentation.html#1): 

```{r include=TRUE}
knitr::include_url('https://acastillogill.com/slides/2019-02-21-r-ladies-data-science-interviews-presentation.html#1')
```

To summarise:

**Would have done differently:**

- Establish healthy boundaries with recruiters
- Focus on the basics for technical tests
- Schedule interviews at favourable times
- Practice not knowing and staying confident


**Glad I did:**

- Be yourself (or as close as possible)
- Have a mentor to support you along the way
- Be transparent about other interviews
- Be kind to everyone you meet (no matter what)

# Why?

I just finished a data scientist job search in London that lasted about a month. It was successful because it ended in the data scientist role I'm about to start. I'm thrilled! Despite the success, there are things I could have done differently to improve all aspects of the search. My specific job search included international relocation, which did not make it easy. The whole process culminated in four job interviews in a row where each day I split my attention between unpacking, studying, researching, and rehearsing. I learned this was not a good idea. I also learned other things in that short, exciting period of time. Now that the dust has settled, I can reflect about the whole process and sit down to distill lessons. I'm writing this with three objectives in mind:

1. **Is there anybody out there?** I'd like to know if others have gone through a similar situation and if so, please leave a comment or write me an e-mail about your experience. It's important to hear about how others overcame the obstacles I had to deal with and what obstacles have others faced.

2. **To guide/advice others:** Of course, this was my personal experience and I would take it with a grain of salt. After all, I'm just one observation and that's why we need a bigger sample size (see objective 1). However, I do hope this will be helpful to someone in their data scientist job search.


3. **For my future self:** Journaling and reflection helps me improve. Hopefully I won't have to go through a job search in a while but as a memento of what has happened I'd like to leave this record.

# Here's how I spent my time

I track time spent working to constantly update my learning loop and efficiently allocate time. I tried to extend this to my job search by tracking as many activities as possible. Here is the key for the tasks I show in the plot along with a short commentary.


```{r read-time}
job_search$date <- dmy(job_search$date)
job_search$task <- as.factor(job_search$task)
job_search <- job_search %>%
  select(date, amount, task) %>%
  filter (date>"2019-01-04")
```


```{r plotting-time-usage, include=TRUE, fig.width=10}
job_search%>%
  group_by(date, task)%>%
  ggplot(aes(x=date, y=amount, fill=task))+
  geom_bar(stat="identity")+
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle=90,hjust=1))+
  scale_x_date(breaks = "1 day")+
  labs(title ="Time usage during data scientist job search",
       x="Date",
       y="Time")+
  scale_fill_brewer(palette = "Paired")
```


## Adapting CVs

On the 5th January 2019 I met up with my mentor (more on this later), we went through my CV and my LinkedIn profile in great detail. After, I dedicated a few hours to putting what she suggested into practice. This task had a great time investment. 


```{r plotting-adapting-CVs, include=TRUE, fig.width=10}
job_search%>%
  group_by(date, task)%>%
  filter(task=="Adapting CVs")%>%
  ggplot(aes(x=date, y=amount, fill=task))+
  geom_bar(stat="identity")+
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle=90,hjust=1))+
  scale_x_date(breaks = "1 day")+
  labs(title ="Time spent adapting CVs",
       x="Date",
       y="Time")+
  expand_limits(x=as.Date(c("2019-01-05","2019-02-12")))+
  scale_fill_manual(values="#A6CEE3" )+
  theme(legend.position = "none")
```


## Face-to-face interviews

This is one of my to-improve points. I scheduled four interviews in one week just two days after I moved countries with all my belongings. DO NOT DO THIS. This was not necessary. I could have spaced out interviews more into the future and with more days in between each one. This definitely had a negative impact on my performance on interviews, especially those scheduled later in the week.


```{r plotting-face-interviews, include=TRUE, fig.width=10}


job_search%>%
  group_by(date, task)%>%
  filter(task=="Face to face interviews")%>%
  ggplot(aes(x=date, y=amount, fill=task))+
  geom_bar(stat="identity")+
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle=90,hjust=1))+
  scale_x_date(breaks = "1 day")+
  labs(title ="Time spent at face-to-face interviews",
       x="Date",
       y="Time")+
  expand_limits(x=as.Date(c("2019-01-05","2019-02-12")))+
  scale_fill_manual(values =   "#1F78B4"   ) +
  theme(legend.position = "none")
```


## Filling out forms

This was a surprise. I thought I would have had to fill out more job applications than I did. The time spent here was minimal because I ended up working mostly with recruiters. I wish I would have tracked it but most of my applications were through LinkedIn. I had the intention to also fill in my details on other job search platforms like Indeed, etc. but this ended up not being necessary. 

```{r plotting-filling-forms, include=TRUE, fig.width=10}


job_search%>%
  group_by(date, task)%>%
  filter(task=="Filling out forms")%>%
  ggplot(aes(x=date, y=amount, fill=task))+
  geom_bar(stat="identity")+
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle=90,hjust=1))+
  scale_x_date(breaks = "1 day")+
  labs(title ="Time spent filling out forms",
       x="Date",
       y="Time")+
  expand_limits(x=as.Date(c("2019-01-05","2019-02-12")))+
  scale_fill_manual(values =   "#B2DF8A"   ) +
  theme(legend.position = "none")
```


## Interview prep

This includes researching companies, preparing for technical tests, doing technical tests, notice the peak on 17th January? That was me prettifying plots as part of a technical test `r emo::ji("nail_care")`

During my interview week I split the day between being at interviews and then cramming for the next. This was not fun and most definitely led to sub-optimal results.


```{r plotting-interview-prep, include=TRUE, fig.width=10}

job_search%>%
  group_by(date, task)%>%
  filter(task=="Interview prep")%>%
  ggplot(aes(x=date, y=amount, fill=task))+
  geom_bar(stat="identity")+
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle=90,hjust=1))+
  scale_x_date(breaks = "1 day")+
  labs(title ="Time spent preparing for interviews",
       x="Date",
       y="Time")+
  expand_limits(x=as.Date(c("2019-01-05","2019-02-12")))+
  scale_fill_manual(values =   "#33A02C"   ) +
  theme(legend.position = "none")
```



## Job admin

This is basically everything related to sending e-mails to arrange phone calls, or interviews, and towards the end, going over the final job offer, signing, sealing it and delivering it to my new employer `r emo::ji("musical_note")`!

```{r plotting-job-admin, include=TRUE, fig.width=10}

job_search%>%
  group_by(date, task)%>%
  filter(task=="Job admin")%>%
  ggplot(aes(x=date, y=amount, fill=task))+
  geom_bar(stat="identity")+
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle=90,hjust=1))+
  scale_x_date(breaks = "1 day")+
  labs(title ="Time spent doing administrative activities",
       x="Date",
       y="Time")+
  expand_limits(x=as.Date(c("2019-01-05","2019-02-12")))+
  scale_fill_manual(values =   "#FB9A99"  ) +
  theme(legend.position = "none")
```


## Phone calls

This is another point to improve. At the beginning I was taking way too many unexpected phone calls from recruiters. This was an inefficient use of our time. After a bit I tried to push back by asking to send job specs first and then scheduling calls. More on this later. Phone calls also included technical interviews but these were actually only about two hours of the total phone call time. 

```{r plotting-phone-calls, include=TRUE, fig.width=10}
phone_calls <- job_search%>%
  filter(task=="Phone calls")%>%
  summarise(phone_call= seconds_to_period(sum(amount)))

job_search%>%
  group_by(date, task)%>%
  filter(task=="Phone calls")%>%
  ggplot(aes(x=date, y=amount, fill=task))+
  geom_bar(stat="identity")+
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle=90,hjust=1))+
  scale_x_date(breaks = "1 day")+
  labs(title ="Time spent on phone calls",
       subtitle=paste("Only about 2.5 hrs of the total ~7 hrs on was spent on phone interviews." ),
       x="Date",
       y="Time")+
  expand_limits(x=as.Date(c("2019-01-05","2019-02-12")))+
  scale_fill_manual(values =  "#E31A1C"  ) +
  theme(legend.position = "none")
```



## Writing cover letters

Again, surprisingly low. Only wrote one cover letter as part of an application and didn't hear back from that company at all. The data scientist job search works in mysterious ways. 

```{r plotting-cover-letters, include=TRUE, fig.width=10}

job_search%>%
  group_by(date, task)%>%
  filter(task=="Writing cover letters")%>%
  ggplot(aes(x=date, y=amount, fill=task))+
  geom_bar(stat="identity")+
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle=90,hjust=1))+
  scale_x_date(breaks = "1 day")+
  labs(title ="Time spent writing cover letters",
       x="Date",
       y="Time")+
  expand_limits(x=as.Date(c("2019-01-05","2019-02-12")))+
  scale_fill_manual(values = "#FDBF6F" ) +
  theme(legend.position = "none")
```



# What would I have done differently?

Here's the fun bit where I tell you how I fell down and scratched my knee so you don't have to. 

## Establish healthy boundaries with recruiters

This was my fast time working with recruiters. I wasn't sure about how much time and attention I should allocate to working with them and/or how to do it. At the beginning I always picked up the phone. Most of the conversations didn't add much value and were more of an interruption and distraction. I wasted a lot of time and headspace taking random recruiter calls that could have been invested elsewhere. 

**What would I do now?**

After a week of this, I set this workflow for myself. My first point of contact is either LinkedIn or my e-mail. If someone were to reach out with a fantastic opportunity that seems especially well suited for me, I would say, "sounds great, please send over the job spec first". I would then sit down and read the job spec. After, I would Google the company, find the employees on LinkedIn and pause. Then I would reflect on whether I want to go forward or not. If I don't feel excited, move on immediately. Politely reply: "Thank you, however, this is not a good fit for me at this time." If you do feel excited, then go ahead and schedule that call. Make sure that you pick up at the time it was scheduled.

## Focus on the basics for technical test prep

There are statistics and programming basics that every data scientist should know. You would think that because they are basics you would never forget them. Not me. During the last few months I had focused on re-writing manuscripts based on analysis done in the summer. I enjoyed the Christmas/New Year break and was focused on moving countries. I hadn't touched some bread and butter activities in a few months nor did I think about refreshing basic data wrangling or stats 101. Instead I was out to impress and googled advanced data science interview questions. This strategy was very flawed. I failed some technical questions that were not hard, I was just out of practice. When I think about it, I was just asked one neural network question, the rest was basics.

**What would I do now?**

I would focus less on specific algorithm details and just throughly freshen up on stats 101, data cleaning and wrangling basics by heart including syntax in both R and SQL.

## Schedule interviews at favourable times

In retrospective I realise I was somewhat nervous about having any time gaps in my CV. This led me to cram moving countries and going to job interviews. I was so excited about the search that I allowed interviews to be scheduled one after another just a few days after moving house. This wasn't necessary and of course had a negative impact on my job search. I couldn't devote my full attention to interview prep.
 
**What would I do now?**

I don't think leaving a one month time gap would have had any negative consequences. Instead it would have given me enough time to settle in to start ramping up the interviewing process. I would also try to schedule interviews with at least one day in between and in the morning, if possible. 

## Rehearse not knowing, or being wrong, and feeling embarrassed/nervous/uncomfortable and STILL speaking with confidence

I have a new found respect for politicians now. When they announce a policy or a plan at a press conference, inevitably they will be asked something they do not know. They might even be corrected on something they just said. The ability to keep calm or appear calm is something they have practiced over and over. I had no idea how important this skill is to practice until I went through this round of interviews. 

Public speaking has a been a priority because when I was younger I was often told I spoke too fast and that I could benefit from adding more intonation to my presentations. With feedback in mind, I took locution lessons and joined public speaking clubs. Generally, you improve on the skill you practice. I had practiced speaking in a safe, controlled environment using rehearsed responses. I therefore, improved on that skill. Public speaking at interviews is a totally different skill. I did not practice not knowing, which is bound to happen at a technical test and carrying on. I let a couple of questions or situations, which unsettled me, have an impact on the rest of my interview. I let a tiny portion that wasn't great bleed into the rest. Not ideal.  

**What would I do now?**

I love public speaking clubs like Toastmasters because they have made me aware of my impact on an audience, for better or for worse. I can tell when people are zoning out and what I have done to cause that. It's helped me improve my pace, pauses and intonation. But what I think would be better practice is joining a debate club. In a debate there is another team actively pushing against you and trying to undermine what you're saying. Constantly. If they're skilled, they might even attempt to provoke a reaction. That's what I need to practice. Can anyone recommend debate clubs in London?

# What would I do again?

## Be yourself (or as close as possible)

Adopting some sort of persona and putting a mask during an interview is not a good idea. On top of the technical work you'll be doing each day, you'll have to do the emotional work of transforming your personality. This is exhausting. Instead, just be yourself. Of course, if someone is more introverted, a little bit of work to show a tiny bit of more enthusiasm during the interview is ok, or if like me, you're a bit too enthusiastic, dialing it back just a bit is not a bad idea. However, if during the interview I project myself as someone I'm not and they make an offer, I'll have to transform myself each day before work. Recipe for unsatisfaction in the workplace I think.

## Have a mentor to support you along the way

Through R-Ladies I met Raquel Redó, a data scientist based in Barcelona. Although the timing wasn't right because I was moving, we made sure we met face to face at least twice. Raquel has been doing data science work for a while and is very enthusiastic about supporting other women in the field. Perfect! She herself had gone through the data science interview process and had very wise words to offer. 
I think what made our mentorship work was that I wrote down all her advice after our first meeting and went off and did it. I put as much of her advice I could into practice. When I had scheduled my final round interviews, we went over the companies and she gave me some advice on them, too. Going through data science interviews can feel a bit lonely and it's easy to doubt yourself. Having a mentor helped me make my search legitimate to myself and kept me accountable. This was good to have. 

## Be transparent about other interviews to everyone

This is very important for several reasons. First, you can manage expectations and follow ups. Imagine interviewing a candidate, offering them a position and then for days not hearing back from them. Rude. Do you even want this person to join your team? It also  helps you have some leverage in terms of package negotiation. Finally, it definitely removed some pressure once I received my initial offer. I was more relaxed in other interviews and accepting of any outcomes. 

## Be kind to everyone you meet (no matter what)

This is where I know I have learnt at least one thing since I was a teenager. I received a rejection. Nobody likes to be rejected and of course it doesn't feel good but I'm glad I stayed kind. We may or may not meet again, it doesn't matter. In retrospective, I feel good about my interactions with everyone I met. I feel glad I listened and gave my best self along the way no matter how confused or tired I felt at some points.

# Conclusion

The data science job search is quite to different to others. In my experience, very little time was spent on filling out forms or writing cover letters. It's more about researching the company to the best of your abilities and keeping your technical and social abilities current and fresh. There are always things to improve upon and by distilling the four lessons I shared, I hope to correct them next time. I also hope to hear from others who have gone through a similar process and learn about their trials and tribulations. There are some things I got right, after all, I'm very excited to start my data scientist job soon. This worked for me but will not necessarily work for you so take them with a grain of salt. Finally, enjoy it! It was fun to go to so many offices and interview my interviewers. I'd like to think we both enjoyed the process. It was nice meeting you! Hope to hear from your experience in the comments or privately through e-mail.
