<h1><span class="header-section-number">2</span> Question</h1>
<p>I know very little about sports, I know so little that when I came across this dataset about “free throws” in basketball, I pretty much had to look up what every column meant, except “Players”. After seeing that all the other columns to some extent say something about “Players”, I decided to explore <strong>who were the “best” players, and why?</strong></p>

<p>The package is available on <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/sebastianmantey/nba-free-throws">Kaggle</a>. It contains 618,019 rows and 11 rows. Each row corresponds to a free throw attempt and there is a column called <code>shot_made</code>, which indicates whether or not the shot was made.</p>
