<h1><span class="header-section-number">2</span> Question</h1>
<p>In a <a href="https://acastillogill.com/2018/11/r-downloads-around-the-world/">previous post</a> I had looked at which countries downloaded R the most. That led me to ask which countries were the most intense R users, using downloads per 1,000 capita as a proxy.</p>
<p>When I was writing the conclusions about the most R-using countries, I tried to draw up patterns. What did those R-using countries have in common? They were mostly “developed” countries. Since developed countries tend to have high levels of academic attainment, I decided to explore the relationship between education levels and R-usage across the globe:</p>
<p><strong>How does the education index relate to R downloads per 1,000 capita?</strong></p>
<p>To answer my question, I identified a metric that would allow me to explore the relationship between education and R usage. That metric turned out to be the UN’s education index, which I will explain below.</p>
</div>
<div id="dataset-description" class="section level1">
<h1><span class="header-section-number">3</span> Dataset description</h1>
<p>I used the <a href="https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/tree/master/data/2018-10-30">Tidy Tuesday dataset</a> for R downloads posted on 30th October 2018. The dataset contained 938,115 observations and eight features corresponding to a unique id, download date, time, size, version, os, country, and IP id. The downloads correspond to a year’s worth of downloads running from 2017-10-20 to 2018-10-20. To prevent any overlap and have one entire year, I limited downloads to 2018-10-19. After I removed missing values, there were 910,351 observations.</p>
<p>For the independent variable, I downloaded the education index for all countries. The education index is a metric published by the United Nations and it corresponds to the average of the Mean Years of Schooling Index (MYSI) and the Expected Years of Schooling Index (EYSI):</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[EI={\frac {{\textrm {MYSI}}+{\textrm {EYSI}}}{2}}\]</span></p>

<p>The relationship between the two variables is linear now - time for a linear regression!</p>
<p>That will take the form:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[ln(downloads\space per \space 1,000 \space capita)=\beta_0+\beta_1*Education\space index + \varepsilon\]</span></p>
<p>The F-statistic will be testing:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[ H_0: \beta_1=0\]</span> <span class="math display">\[ H_A: \beta_1\neq 0\]</span></p>

<p>After checking out the residuals, I saw there are a few outliers, mainly Turkmenistan, Tajikistan, Libya, Burkina Faso, and Chad. I decided to leave them in because it’s interesting to think about what specific characteristcs contribute to them being be under or over the trend line. The model I proposed, explains 64.41 of the variation in the data. It’s not a lot but it’s also not insignificant. After having tried to fit a multiple linear regression model with other variables such as GDP and life expectancy, I found the education index to be the best predictor of R downloads per 1,000 capita.</p>
</div>
<div id="results" class="section level1">
<h1><span class="header-section-number">5</span> Results</h1>
<p>Based on the model:</p>
<p><span class="math inline">\(ln(downloads\space per \space 1,000 \space capita)=-9.9203 +0.1034*Education\space index + \varepsilon\)</span></p>
<p>and the F-Statistic with p-value 0, we can reject <span class="math inline">\(H_0\)</span> and say that there is a relationship between the education index and R Downloads per 1,000 capita.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>The education index explains 64.41 percent of the variation in R Downloads per 1,000 capita around the world.</p></li>
<li><p>The geometric mean of R downloads per 1,000 capita is 0.</p></li>
<li><p>A one unit increase in the education index, is expected to increase on average, R downloads per 1,000 capita by a factor of 1.109:</p></li>
</ul>
<p><span class="math display">\[log(Education\space index\space +1) - log(Education\space index)=0.1034\]</span></p>
<p><span class="math display">\[log({\frac{Education\space index\space +1}{Education\space index}})=0.1034\]</span></p>
<p><span class="math display">\[e^{log({\frac{Education\space index\space +1}{Education\space index}})}=e^{0.1034}\]</span> <span class="math display">\[\frac{Education\space index\space +1}{Education\space index}=1.109\]</span></p>
<p>The corresponding confidence interval is:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\mathbb{P} (e^{lower\space bound}&lt;\frac{Education\space index\space +1}{Education\space index}&lt;e^{upper\space bound})=0.95\]</span> The lower bound is <span class="math display">\[point\space estimate-2*SE=0.1034-2*0.0059=0.0916\]</span> and the upper bound is <span class="math display">\[point\space estimate+2*SE=0.1034+2*0.0059=0.1152\]</span></p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\mathbb{P} (e^{0.0916}&lt;\frac{Education\space index\space +1}{Education\space index}&lt;e^{0.1152})=0.95\]</span> so the final confidence interval is: <span class="math display">\[\mathbb{P}(1.096&lt;\frac{Education\space index\space +1}{Education\space index}&lt;1.122)=0.95\]</span></p>
<p>We can see this increase by plotting the fitted values:</p>
