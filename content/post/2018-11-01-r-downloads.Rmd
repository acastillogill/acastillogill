description: "In this blogpost I analysed a dataset containing downloads of the R software in one year, spanning from October 2017 to 2018. Unsurprisingly, I found that large countries have the most total downloads. I then decide to explore downloads per 1,000 capita and find that small, developed countries around the world have the most downloads. Finally, I look into which the times of the year are most common for downloading R. I find that almost everywhere, the summer isn't a very popular season for R downloads."

# Summary

*To see the code used in this post, visit my [kernel on kaggle in R Markdown format](https://www.kaggle.com/adcastillogill/r-downloads-around-the-world/code).* 

- Objectives: To spatially visualise a dataset to understand global trends.
- Challenge: Using the `tmap` package.
- Data points: `r nrow(r_downloads)*length(r_downloads)`
- Language: R 

# Question

What countries download R the most? Where are they? And who are the most *intense* R users measured by R downloads per 1,000 capita?
Which months of the year are the most popular times to download R? Does it depend on the season? What variable could we attempt to use as a predictor of R downloads? Could we use linear regression for inference?

# Dataset description 

I used the [Tidy Tuesday dataset](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/tree/master/data/2018-10-30) for R downloads posted on 30th October 2018. The dataset contained 938,115 observations and eight features corresponding to a unique id, download date, time, size, version, os, country, and IP id. The downloads correspond to a year's worth of downloads running from 2017-10-20 to 2018-10-20. To prevent any overlap and have one entire year, I limited downloads until 2018-10-19. After I removed missing values, there were `r nrow(r_downloads)` observations.



## Total R Downloads

So what are the top ten countries with the most downloads? 

```{r read-data}
iso_codes <- read_csv(here::here("static","data","iso_countries.csv"))

pop <-read_csv(here::here("static","data","country_populations.csv"))

map_path <- here::here("static","data","world_shapefile","world_shapefile.shp")
world <- sf::st_read(map_path)

educ <- read_csv(here::here("static","data","edu_year.csv"))

educ$edu_index <- as.double(educ$edu_index)

```

```{r merge-country-codes}
r_downloads%<>%
  full_join(iso_codes, by=c("country"="iso"))%>%
  filter(!is.na(sub_region))
```

```{r downloads-by-country}
r_downloads%>%
  group_by(name)%>%
  summarise(n=n())%>%
  filter(!is.na(n))%>%
  arrange(desc(n))->downloads_per_country
```



```{r plot-top-10-countries, fig.cap="The US has almost six times as many downloads than the second country China.", include=TRUE}

blues <- brewer.pal(9,"BuPu")
blue_range <- colorRampPalette(blues)

downloads_per_country%>%
  arrange(desc(n))%>%
  head(10)%>%
  mutate(name=fct_reorder(name,n))%>%
  ggplot(aes(name,n,fill=name))+
  geom_col()+
  expand_limits(y=0)+
  coord_flip()+
  scale_y_continuous(labels=comma_format())+
  labs(title="Top 10 countries by R downloads in 2017/18",
       x="",
       y="Downloads")+
  theme_ipsum_rc()+
  theme(legend.position = "none")+
  scale_fill_manual(values=blue_range(10))


  
```

```{r create-tibble-with-pop-and-users-only}
full_maps <- downloads_per_country%>%
  full_join(iso_codes, by=c("name"="name"))%>%
  filter(!is.na(sub_region))%>%
  left_join(pop, by=c("name"="name"))%>%
  select(n, name, iso_3, region, sub_region, pop_2018)%>%
  mutate(n_capita=n/pop_2018)%>%
  filter(!is.na(n_capita),
         pop_2018!=0)
```

```{r merge-full-maps-and-map-path}
world_full <- world%>%
  left_join(full_maps, by=c("ISO3"="iso_3"))
```

```{r create-total-downloads-map}
n_map <- tm_shape(world_full) + 
  tm_borders(col="black", lwd=0.1)+
    tm_fill(col="n",n=4, style="jenks", palette = get_brewer_pal("BuPu", n = 4, contrast = c(0.13, 0.9))) + 
tm_layout(main.title = "Total R downloads in 2017/18",
          main.title.size = 1, frame = FALSE, bg.color = "aliceblue", title.position = c("right","bottom"))+
tm_legend(position=c("left", "bottom"), bg.color="white", frame=FALSE, legend.title.size=1)
```
And what about other countries and regions?
```{r plot-total-downloads-map, include=TRUE, fig.cap="Besides the US, China, Germany, and other countries featured in the top 10, the map allows us to see which countries in each country downloaded R the most. These are Colombia and Brazil in South America; Mexico in Central America; and Italy, France and Poland in Europe."}
n_map
```

## Total R Downloads per 1,000 capita

Some countries are heavier R users measured by the number of downloads per 1,000 capita. I wanted to see how this compared with total downloads. 

```{r plot-top-10-countries-per-capita, fig.cap="Hong Kong, Switzerland, and Iceland, had more than two downloads per 1,000 capita during the 2017/18 period.", include=TRUE}
yellows <- brewer.pal(9,"OrRd")
yellow_range <- colorRampPalette(yellows)

full_maps%>%
  arrange(desc(n_capita))%>%
  head(10)%>%
  mutate(name=fct_reorder(name,n_capita))%>%
  ggplot(aes(name,n_capita,fill=name))+
  geom_col()+
  expand_limits(y=0)+
  coord_flip()+
  scale_y_continuous(labels=comma_format())+
  labs(title="Top 10 countries by \n R downloads per 1,000 capita in 2017/18",
       x="",
       y="Downloads")+
  theme_ipsum_rc()+
  theme(legend.position = "none")+
  scale_fill_manual(values=yellow_range(10))
  
```

And again, how does this look like around the world?

```{r create-downloads-per-capita-map}
n_capita_map <- tm_shape(world_full) + 
  tm_borders(col="black", lwd=0.1)+
    tm_fill(col="n_capita",n=4, title="n_capita (in 1,000s)",style="jenks", palette = get_brewer_pal("OrRd", n = 4, contrast = c(0.13, 0.9))) + 
tm_layout(main.title = "R downloads per 1,000 capita in 2017/18",
          main.title.size = 1, frame = FALSE, bg.color = "aliceblue", title.position = c("right","bottom"))+
tm_legend(position=c("left", "bottom"), bg.color="white", frame=FALSE, legend.title.size=1)
```

```{r plot-downloads-per-capita-map, include=TRUE, fig.cap="Besides the top 10 downloads per 1,000 capita plot, here we see that Uruguay and Chile in South America have the most downloads per 1,000 capita; Costa Rica in Central America; and Japan in Asia."}
n_capita_map
```

## Times of the year with most downloads

I wonder at what times in the year are most popular for R downloads. Does it change amongst regions?

```{r create-r-downloads-per-region}
monthly_downloads_per_region <- r_downloads%>%
#Group by the month of the year
 group_by(month(date), sub_region)%>%
#Count downloads by the month of the year
summarise(monthly_downloads=n())%>%
#Pipe to make a plot
ggplot(aes(x=`month(date)`,y= monthly_downloads))+
#Add line
geom_line(alpha=0.5, color="seagreen4")+
geom_point(color="seagreen4")+
scale_x_continuous(breaks=c(seq(1,12,1)))+
#Add nice commas y axis
scale_y_continuous(labels=comma_format())+
 #Add title
labs(title="Monthly R downloads around the world 2017/2018",
y="Downloads",
x="Month",
caption = "Data source: Tidy Tuesday (2018-10-30)")+
facet_wrap(~sub_region, scales="free", nrow = 6)+
  theme(strip.background =element_rect(fill="white"))+
  theme(strip.text = element_text(size=8,face="bold"))+
  theme(title =element_text(size=12, face='bold'))+
  theme_classic()
```

```{r plot-monthly-downloads-per-region, include=TRUE, fig.cap="It seems like not everybody loves the sunshine, #RStats doesn't. The summer months had the least downloads around the world with the exception of Sub-Saharan Africa and the Pacific Islander regions." ,fig.height=12}
monthly_downloads_per_region 
```

# Conclusion

In this post I analysed a dataset that contained downloads of R software around the world spanning a one year period between 2017 and 2018. Using the `tidyverse`, `lubridate`, and `tmap`packages, I found out which countries download the software the most. Since large countries with large populations will have more total downloads, I decided to inspect number downloads per 1,000 capita. This extra step revealed that small, developed countries, such as Hong Kong, Switzerland, Iceland, Singapore, Liechtenstein, the Netherlands and Denmark have the most downloads per 1,000 capita. An exception to this were the US and Australia with at least one download per 1,000 capita despite being larger countries. Lastly, I looked into which months had the most R downloads by sub-regions and found that almost everywhere, there are few R downloads during the summer. 

```{r merge-years-of-education}

full_maps_edu <- full_maps%>%
  left_join(educ, by="name")%>%
  na.omit()

```


```{r create-model-of-educ-r-capita}
fit <- lm( log(n_capita) ~ edu_index, data = full_maps_edu)
summary(fit)
par(mfrow=c(2,2))
plot(fit)
```

```{r plot-relationship-between-educ-and-n-capita}
ggplot(full_maps_edu, aes(x=edu_index, y=log(n_capita)))+
  geom_point(alpha=0.5)+
  geom_smooth(method="lm")
```


```{r cowplot-for-r-downloads}
no_title_map_1 <- tm_shape(world_full) + 
  tm_borders(col="black", lwd=0.1)+
    tm_fill(col="n",n=4, style="jenks", palette = get_brewer_pal("BuPu", n = 4, contrast = c(0.13, 0.9))) + 
tm_layout(main.title.size = 1, frame = FALSE, bg.color = "aliceblue", title.position = c("right","bottom"))+
tm_legend(position=c("left", "bottom"), bg.color="white", frame=FALSE, legend.title.size=1)
```
