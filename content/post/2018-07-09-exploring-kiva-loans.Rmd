# Summary

*To see the code used in this post, visit my [kernel on kaggle in R Markdown format](https://www.kaggle.com/adcastillogill/exploring-kiva-loans).* 

In this post I analyse 671,205 [Kiva](www.kiva.org) loans from around the world. I find that single female is the gender that requests the most loans. The main uses for Kiva loans are agriculture, retail, and food with some variations amongst regions. Half of the loans are 4.22 USD or less and are funded by 12 or less contributers. The median time between posting on the Kiva platform and disbursing it to the borrower is 16.89 days. I mainly use the tidyverse, stringr, and quantmode packages.

# Purpose of this post

Muhammad Yunus and the Grameen Bank won the [Nobel Peace Prize](https://www.nobelpeaceprize.org/Prize-winners/Winners/2006) in 2006 for "their efforts through microcredit to create economic and social development from below."

Back in 1976, Yunus, at the time a professor at the University of Chittagong (Bangladesh), [noticed that small amounts of money could make a substantial difference to people living in poverty](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-south-asia-11901625). He started to loan money to people that didn't meet the requirements listed by the mainstream banking system. It was reported that these type of loans were effective to ["emerge" from poverty](https://www.nobelpeaceprize.org/Prize-winners/Prizewinner-documentation/Muhammad-Yunus-Grameen-Bank) using default rates lower than those of commercial banks, [reported at 2%](https://www.gdrc.org/icm/grameen-article4.html). Eventually, in October 1983, Muhammad Yunus founded [Grameen Bank](https://grameenfoundation.org/about/history), considered to be the first microfinance institution. 

Founded in 2005, [Kiva](www.kiva.org), has the same mission as Grameen Bank except that anyone can become a Kiva banker. This online platform enables microcredit lending to help low-income entrepreneurs around the world with a couple of clicks. Pretty neat, huh? In this post, I unpack a large dataset published by [Kiva on the Kaggle platform](https://www.kaggle.com/kiva/data-science-for-good-kiva-crowdfunding) and explore these microloans. 

# The data

The dataset was published during the first months of 2018 on the [Kaggle platform](https://www.kaggle.com/kiva/data-science-for-good-kiva-crowdfunding). 

The complete dataset was a zip file with size 232.7 MB containing four files: `kiva_loans.csv`, `kiva_mpi_region_locations.csv`,`loan_theme_ids.csv`, and `loan_themes_by_region.csv`. After I looked at the contents, I chose to work with the first one `kiva_loans.csv`.

```{r results='hide', eval=FALSE}
path <- "/Volumes/TOSHIBAEXT/RStudio/blog/content/post/kiva_data/"
#Read `kiva_loans.csv`
kiva_loans <- read_csv(paste0(path,"kiva_loans.csv"))
```

```{r eval=FALSE}
#Save cleaned data for future posts.
path_2 <- here::here("static","data")
saveRDS(kiva_loans,paste0(path_2,"kiva_loans.rds"))
```

```{r read-data}
kiva_loans <- readRDS(here::here("static","data","datakiva_loans.rds"))
```

The dataset had 671,205 observations and 20 variables.

```{r results='hide'}
#Get a glimpse of kiva_loans
glimpse(kiva_loans)
```

Some of the codebook came with the dataset and some I researched to make assumptions:

- `funded_amount`: "The amount disbursed by Kiva to the field agent(USD)"
- `loan_amount`: "The amount disbursed by the field agent to the borrower(USD)"
- `activity`: "More granular category"
- `sector`: "High level category"
- `use`: "Exact usage of loan amount"
- `country_code`: "ISO country code of country in which loan was disbursed"
- `country`: "Full country name of country in which loan was disbursed"
- `region`: "Full region name within the country"
- `currency`: "The currency in which the loan was disbursed"
- `partner_id`: "ID of partner organization"

This variable has a lot of missing values and the Kiva explanation on Kaggle doesn't go much further. For now, I will exclude `partner_id`. 

- `posted_time`: "The time at which the loan is posted on Kiva by the field agent"
- `disbursed_time`: "The time at which the loan is disbursed by the field agent to the borrower"
- `funded_time`: "The time at which the loan posted to Kiva gets funded by lenders completely"
- `term_in_months`: "The duration for which the loan was disbursed in months"
- `lender_count`: "The total number of lenders that contributed to this loan"
- `borrower_genders`: "Comma separated M,F letters, where each instance represents a single male/female in the group"
- `repayment_interval`: Not specified so we'll assume that it means the standard definition of when the loan is repaid back to the lender.

# Data cleaning 
```{r}

#Select variables 
kiva_loans %>%
  dplyr::select (id,
          loan_amount,
          sector,
          country_code,
          currency,
          posted_time,
          disbursed_time,
          term_in_months,
          lender_count,
          borrower_genders,
          repayment_interval,
          funded_time) -> kiva_loans

#Convert country_code, sector, currency, borrower_genders, and repayment_interval to factors.
categorical <- c("sector",
                 "country_code",
                 "currency",
                 "borrower_genders",
                 "repayment_interval")

kiva_loans[categorical] <- lapply(kiva_loans[categorical],
                                  factor)
```

From  at the structure of our data, we can soon see there are a few bits that don't make sense and need to be fixed. 

**a. Missing values**

We will leave missing values in for now. 

**b. `borrower_genders`**

From the variable descriptions, we expected `borrower_genders`to have only two levels, `male`or `female`. Here we see many more levels, 11,298 to be precise. This isn't very clear so we'll fix that first by creating five levels:

```{r }

#Turn kiva_loans back into an atomic vector of characters
kiva_loans$borrower_genders <- as.character(kiva_loans$borrower_genders)

#Split each row into multiple strings
genders <- str_split(kiva_loans$borrower_genders, ", ")

#Assign 1 for female and 0 for male
females_count <- lapply(genders, str_count, pattern="female")

#Count how many females are in each list element
females_sum <- lapply(females_count, sum)

#Create a function that takes the two lists just made
compare_genders <- function(females_count, females_sum){
  
  #Set "single_female" when female sum and length is 1
  ifelse (females_sum==1&&length(females_count)==1, "single_female",
          
  #Set "mult_females" when female sum and length females_count is the same and different to zero
  ifelse(females_sum==length(females_count)&&females_sum!=0,"mult_females",
         
  #Set "single_male" #Set "mult_males" when female sum is zero and the count of individuals is 1
  ifelse(females_sum==0&&length(females_count)==1,"single_male",
         
  #Set "mult_males" when female sum is zero and the count of individuals is greater than 1
  ifelse(females_sum==0&&length(females_count)>1,"mult_males",
         
  #Set "mixed_genders" when the sum of females is different to the count of individual       
  ifelse(females_sum!=length(females_count),"mixed_genders","strange")))))
  
}
#Apply function compare_genders
kiva_loans$borrower_genders <- mapply(compare_genders,females_count,females_sum)
```

```{r}

#Make kiva_loans$borrower_genders a factor again
kiva_loans$borrower_genders <- as.factor(kiva_loans$borrower_genders)

#Check levels
levels(kiva_loans$borrower_genders)
```

**c. `loan_amounts`**

Now, since we're trying to make sense of all loans, it's better if `loan_amounts` is in the same currency. Let's translate it to USD.

```{r eval=FALSE}

for (curr in levels(kiva_loans$currency))
  
  #Check that all currencies do not return any errors when requesting a currency conversion
  tryCatch(quantmod::getQuote(paste0(curr, "=X")), error = print)
```


```{r}
## It seems like two currencies are returning an error. Let's filter them out. 
#Turning kiva_loans back into a character vector
kiva_loans$currency <- as.character(kiva_loans$currency)

kiva_loans%>%
  #Filter out "SSP"
  dplyr::filter(currency!="SSP")%>% 
  
  #Filter out "ZWD"
  filter(currency!="ZWD")->kiva_loans 

#Turn kiva_loans$currency back into a factor
kiva_loans$currency <- as.factor(kiva_loans$currency) 

#Store all levels as vector `from`
from <- as.vector(levels(kiva_loans$currency)) 

#Create a vector `to` with requested currency "USD"
to <- rep(length(levels(kiva_loans$currency)),x="USD") 

#Create a dataframe `currencies` with conversion rates `Last`
currencies <- quantmod::getQuote(paste0(from, to, "=X"))
  

```

```{r}
#Set row names as columns in the currencies dataframe

currencies <- rownames_to_column(currencies)

#Split currencies$rownames by extracting the first 3 characters

currencies$currency <-  substring(currencies$rowname, 1,3)

#currencies <- readRDS(file="/Users/AngelaDelgado/Desktop/currencies.rds")

kiva_loans%>%
  #Join currencies to kiva_loans by="currency"
  left_join(currencies, by="currency") -> kiva_loans

kiva_loans%>%
  #Convert the loan from its original currency to USD
  mutate(loan_usd=loan_amount*Last)-> kiva_loans
```

**d. `country_codes`**

Finally, with 86 countries, we have 86 levels. Perhaps it would be interesting to create another category called region to produce less levels and have a better understanding of the overall function of regional distributions.

Our country codes are in the ISO3166 format, so we will use the associated region code found [here](https://dev.maxmind.com/geoip/legacy/codes/country_region/). And make five regions. Africa, Asia, Europe, Oceania, and South America.

```{r}
#Read `country_region.csv`
regions <- read_csv(here::here("static","data","iso_countries.csv"))
```

```{r}
kiva_loans%>%
  #Join currencies to kiva_loans by="country_code"
  left_join(regions, by=c("country_code"="iso")) -> kiva_loans
```

```{r}
kiva_loans$region <- as.factor(kiva_loans$region)
levels(kiva_loans$region)
```


**e. Dates**

Let's calculate two lengths of time that I think are interesting. First, how much time passes from the moment the loan is posted to the moment it's disbursed (`total_time`). Second, how long does a loan take to get funded (`giving_time`)? 

```{r total_time_creation}
kiva_loans%>%
  mutate(total_time_num=as.numeric(difftime(posted_time,
                                            disbursed_time,
                                            units = "days")),
         giving_time_num=as.numeric(difftime(funded_time,
                                             posted_time,
                                             units = "days"))) ->kiva_loans

```

```{r, results='hide'}
#Select variables 
kiva_loans %>%
  dplyr::select (id,
          loan_usd,
          sector, 
          region,
          term_in_months,
          lender_count,
          borrower_genders,
          repayment_interval,
          total_time_num,
          giving_time_num,
          country_code,
          posted_time,
          funded_time,
          disbursed_time)%>%
  arrange(posted_time)-> kiva_loans
kiva_loans$country_code <- as.factor(kiva_loans$country_code)
kiva_loans$id <- as.character(kiva_loans$id)
#Skim the dataset
skim(kiva_loans)
```

# Exploratory data analysis

Now, let's describe the data starting with some plots and tables to understand it.

```{r}
kiva_loans <-  kiva_loans%>%
  filter(region!="EU",
         repayment_interval!="weekly",
         sector!="Construction"&
          sector!="Entertainment"&
           sector!= "Manufacturing"&
            sector!= "Wholesale")%>%
  droplevels()%>%
  na.omit()
```

In all regions, single females request the most loans followed by single males. In Asia and South America, the third category is multiple females while in Africa it's mixed genders.

Notice most loans are requested by single females, the least amount of loans are given in the EU, weekly repayment is an unpopular form of paying loans back and entertainment, wholesale, manufacturing, and construction amount less than 2.2% of sectors.

Let's see how the top 10 changes when it comes to internet users. I used [this ranking](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_number_of_Internet_users), which is based on numbers published by the [International Telecommunications Union](https://www.itu.int/en/Pages/default.aspx).

# Techniques used

- I used the `quantmode` package to convert all loans into a unique currency (US dollars) for comparison. There were two currencies that were unavailable.

- Taking all the different levels that came in the `borrower_genders` variable and creating five neat categories to better understand who are the borrowers was good practice with lists and the `stringr` package. 

# Questions from this analysis

- Why is `Retail` and not `Food` (as in other regions) the second most common use for loans in Asia. 

- Who are the givers? Where are they? Does proximity of the lender to the borrower have anything to do with funding times?

- Does the Kiva website have anything to do with funding times? For example, `giving_time`, the time between posting the loan and the loan being fully funded, has two peaks, at around one week and one month. Is this due to the platform and the promotion of loans that have been posted for a certain amount of time?
