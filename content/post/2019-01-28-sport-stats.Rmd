# Summary 

*To see the all the code used in this post, visit my [GitHub repository for this site](https://github.com/acastillogill/acastillogill)* 

- Objectives: Visually understand who were the best NBA players between 2006 and 2016 and why. 
- Challenge: Using the list-column workflow and the Purrr package. 
- Data points: `r nrow(NBA)*length(NBA)`
- Language: R 



# Question

I know very little about sports, I know so little that when I came across this dataset about "free throws" in basketball, I pretty much had to look up what every column meant, except "Players". After seeing that all the other columns to some extent say something about "Players", I decided to explore **who were the "best" players, and why?**



# Dataset description

The package is available on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/sebastianmantey/nba-free-throws). It contains `r nrow(NBA)` rows and `r length(NBA)` rows. Each row corresponds to a free throw attempt and there is a column called `shot_made`, which indicates whether or not the shot was made. 





```{r assign-correct-variable-type}
#Assign factor columns to a vector factors

factors <- c("end_result",
             "game",
             "game_id",
             "play",
             "player",
             "playoffs",
             "score",
             "season")

#Assign factor type to factors
NBA[factors] <- lapply(NBA[factors], factor)
```
