<p>Spring is my favourite season. I wish blooms were a year-round thing. There’s a gorgeous cherry blossom in my garden that has greeted me with so much beauty over that past two weeks. When its petals started falling off I felt like grabbing some glue and sticking them back on. Alas! I can’t stick petals back onto trees, but I can make this month’s learnings stick by summarising them here:</p>
<p>On April 8th Greg Wilson from RStudio presented What Every Data Scientist Should About Education. This was shared widely within my organisation who the next day organised a Data Engineering MeetUp at the London Google offices. One my current goals is to get better at data engineering. So there I sat with my data scientist colleagues, front and center, ready for all the tips and we got them.</p>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/ixek">Tania Allard is a Developer Advocate at Microsoft</a>. She discussed the relationship between Data Engineers and Data Scientists at companies.</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>There is friction between data engineers and data scientists at organisations.</p></li>
<li><p>This friction is due to the lack of clearly defined roles.</p></li>
<li><p>The data engineer has a set of responsibilities.</p></li>
<li><p>There are certain points when they can contribute to the data scientist’s work.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>Sometimes there is tension between data engineers and data scientists at organisations. It occurs at moments when there is “an unreasonable request” ({INSERT LINK ABOUT MAGICAL REQUESTS},{EXAMPLES ABOUT THESE UNREASONABLE REQUESTS}) made to the data scientist. In turn, this request is pushed to the the data engineer.</p>
<p>Why does this happen? According to Tania, because the lack of clearly defined outputs and roles for these two roles. As Kasia Kulma via Tom Ewing proposed this past Saturday at the Data Science Festival, empathy is key to solve friction {GET LINKS FOR THIS}. As a solution Tanya proposes empathy. She asks both data scientists and data engineers to understand what blockers do each have and how can they mutually work together to remove those blockers. To clarify what is the data engineer’s role, she quotes the AI hierarchy of needs. She talks about the how the most important thing is to have a good data strategy. This starts at the the bottom with good data collection, followed by movement and storing of this data, and then exploration and transformations. Only when these things are in place can then a company move to do “fancier things”.</p>
<p>To clarify the roles of data engineering in small companies, she quoted the need for data warehouses. Without this data science can become either too expensive or not scalable. She mentioned risks of security and costs.</p>
<p>Also, not only warehouse and data infrastructure provision, but also they need to define standards, best practices and certification and validation processes for data objects.</p>
<p>Data engineers are also librarians by cataloguing and organising metadata, defining processes to extract data.</p>
<p>Finally she mentioned ETL, extract, transform and load data, one of the most important activities a data engineer can perform.</p>
<p>Extract refers to waiting for upstream data to be available and then to be transported to another location. Transformation, the heart of the processes in Tanya’s words, requires a lot of business understanding and domain knowledge.</p>

<p>Here is where the data scientist can help the data engineer.</p>
<p>The final step is loading the data, when it can be ready for analysis. The data should be able to be traceable up until this point.</p>
<p>Data engineers help the data scientist through any of these specific activities: data ingestion, metric computation, anomaly detection, experimentation, and instrumentation.</p>
<p>Because of everything mentioned and all the points at which data engineers can help the data scientist, the perspective towards data engineers should be changed.</p>
<p>She ended the talk by inviting us to regard the data engineers as Gandalf’s, making sure that no garbage shall pass, because, you know it: garbage in, garbage out.</p>

<p>Busy week that one. On 11th April I learned that only 7.8% of projects are delivered on time and on budget. Apparently there’s a great deal of research and the audience of Data Analysis of 11,000 Projects: Changing How Projects are Delivered was keen to learn from Alexander Budzier’s research.</p>
<p>On Tuesday 16th I learned about decision-making, for adults! The room was packed and the crowd was excited. I had no clue what I was in for. So glad I went and heard Liz Keogh explain how cognitive biases affect project planning and delivery.</p>
<p>“Raise your hand if you’ve ever been asked to give an estimate in time and money on something you’ve never done.”</p>
<p>The whole rooms raises their hands and like, so totally relates. So many interesting concepts introduced. My favourite was the relationship between information and project planning. All the planning and key decisions are made</p>
