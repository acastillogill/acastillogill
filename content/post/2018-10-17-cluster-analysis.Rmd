description: "In this blog post, I set out to explain the relationship between the education index and R downloads per 1,000 capita across the globe. To do this, I identified an education based metric for all countries. I then regressed R downloads per 1,000 capita onto the education index. I found that the education index (values from 2016) explains about 64.6% of variation in R downloads per 1,000 capita. There were several outliers including Turkmenistan, Tajikistan, Libya, Burkina Faso, and Chad."

# Summary

*To see the all the code used in this post, visit my [GitHub repository for this site](https://github.com/acastillogill/acastillogill)* 

- Objectives: To find what what kind of clusters are there in the seatbelts dataset. 
- Challenge: To implement a clustering algorithm for the first time.
- Data points: `r length(seatbelts)*nrow(seatbelts)`
- Language: R
