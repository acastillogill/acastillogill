<p>So how did my first month as a data scientist go, I hear you ask? Well what better way to answer than by opening a bit of data.</p>
<p><em>To see the all the code used in this post, visit my <a href="https://github.com/acastillogill/acastillogill">GitHub repository for this site</a></em></p>
<p>Many moons ago I came across an app called <a href="https://moodnotes.thriveport.com/">Moodnotes</a>. The app intends to help the user understand their moods based on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognitive_behavioral_therapy">cognitive behavioual therapy (CBT)</a>. When I first find out about the app in 2015, I didnâ€™t know how to code so I didnâ€™t care about the appâ€™s data export feature. I kept using it throughout the years and when I learned about the <a href="https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/tidytext/vignettes/tidytext.html">tidytext package</a>, I immediately knew I wanted use my Moodnotes data and tidytext it as much as I could.</p>
<p>In this post I tidytext my March 2019 data. I picked this month because it shows how I felt during my first month as a data scientist/consultant in London.</p>
<p>After importing the data, we have the columns <code>Date</code>, <code>How are you feeling?</code>, <code>What happened?</code>, <code>Positive feelings?</code>, <code>Negative feelings</code>, <code>What thought went through your mind that contributed most to your negative feeling?</code>, <code>What have you learned today/What are you grateful for?</code>, <code>Did you fall into any traps?</code>, <code>What's another way of thinking about the situation without traps?</code>.</p>
<p>First I chose to plot my daily reported mood. So at the end of everyday I fill out a moodnotes exercise to reflect on my day. It all starts with a measurement from <strong>1</strong> to <strong>5</strong>, where <strong>5</strong> is feeling <em>Over the moon ðŸŒ”</em> and <strong>1</strong> is <em>Dismal ðŸ˜­</em>.</p>

Mmmm given that I was on a new job, on new projects, it makes complete sense for this to be my most frequent thinking trap." width="672" />
