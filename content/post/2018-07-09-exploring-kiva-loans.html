<div id="purpose-of-this-post" class="section level1">
<h1><span class="header-section-number">2</span> Purpose of this post</h1>
<p>Muhammad Yunus and the Grameen Bank won the <a href="https://www.nobelpeaceprize.org/Prize-winners/Winners/2006">Nobel Peace Prize</a> in 2006 for “their efforts through microcredit to create economic and social development from below.”</p>
<p>Back in 1976, Yunus, a professor at the University of Chittagong (Bangladesh) at the time, <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-south-asia-11901625">noticed that small amounts of money could make a substantial difference to people living in poverty</a>. He started to loan money to people that didn’t meet the requirements listed by the mainstream banking system. Not only did these type of loans turn out to be effective to <a href="https://www.nobelpeaceprize.org/Prize-winners/Prizewinner-documentation/Muhammad-Yunus-Grameen-Bank">“emerge” from poverty</a>, but default rates were lower than those of commercial banks, <a href="https://www.gdrc.org/icm/grameen-article4.html">reported at 2%</a>. Eventually, in October 1983, Muhammad Yunus founded <a href="https://grameenfoundation.org/about/history">Grameen Bank</a>, considered to be the first microfinance institution.</p>
<p>Founded in 2005, <a href="www.kiva.org">Kiva</a>, has the same mission as Grameen Bank except that anyone can become a Kiva banker. This online platform enables microcredit lending to help low-income entrepreneurs around the world with a couple of cliks. Pretty neat, huh? In this post, I unpack a large dataset published by <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/kiva/data-science-for-good-kiva-crowdfunding">Kiva on the Kaggle platform</a> and explore these cool microloans.</p>
</div>
<div id="the-data" class="section level1">
<h1><span class="header-section-number">3</span> The data</h1>
<p>The dataset was published during the first months of 2018 on the <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/kiva/data-science-for-good-kiva-crowdfunding">Kaggle platform</a>.</p>
<p>The complete dataset was a zip file with size 232.7 MB containing four files: <code>kiva_loans.csv</code>, <code>kiva_mpi_region_locations.csv</code>,<code>loan_theme_ids.csv</code>, and <code>loan_themes_by_region.csv</code>. After I looked at the contents, I chose to work with the first one.</p>
<p>The dataset was large with 671,205 observations and 20 variables.</p>

<p>Some of the codebook came with the dataset and some I researched to make assumptions:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>funded_amount</code>: “The amount disbursed by Kiva to the field agent(USD)”</li>
<li><code>loan_amount</code>: “The amount disbursed by the field agent to the borrower(USD)”</li>
<li><code>activity</code>: “More granular category”</li>
<li><code>sector</code>: “High level category”</li>
<li><code>use</code>: “Exact usage of loan amount”</li>
<li><code>country_code</code>: “ISO country code of country in which loan was disbursed”</li>
<li><code>country</code>: “Full country name of country in which loan was disbursed”</li>
<li><code>region</code>: “Full region name within the country”</li>
<li><code>currency</code>: “The currency in which the loan was disbursed”</li>
<li><code>partner_id</code>: “ID of partner organization”</li>
</ul>
<p>This variable has a lot of missing values and the Kiva explanation on Kaggle doesn’t go much further. For now, I will exclude <code>partner_id</code>.</p>
<ul>
<li><code>posted_time</code>: “The time at which the loan is posted on Kiva by the field agent”</li>
<li><code>disbursed_time</code>: “The time at which the loan is disbursed by the field agent to the borrower”</li>
<li><code>funded_time</code>: “The time at which the loan posted to Kiva gets funded by lenders completely”</li>
<li><code>term_in_months</code>: “The duration for which the loan was disbursed in months”</li>
<li><code>lender_count</code>: “The total number of lenders that contributed to this loan”</li>
<li><code>borrower_genders</code>: “Comma separated M,F letters, where each instance represents a single male/female in the group”</li>
<li><code>repayment_interval</code>: Not specified so we’ll assume that it means the standard definition of when the loan is repaid back to the lender.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div id="data-cleaning" class="section level1">
<h1><span class="header-section-number">4</span> Data cleaning</h1>
<p>From at the structure of our data, we can soon see there are a few bits that don’t make sense and need to be fixed.</p>
<p><strong>a. Missing values</strong></p>
<p>Missing values, aka <code>NA's</code>, we could simply remove them since we have plenty of observations. But what if by removing them we introduce some bias. For example, <code>borrower_genders</code> has plenty of missing values, but what if this could say something about certain types of loans. For now we will leave them in.</p>
<p><strong>b.<code>borrower_genders</code></strong></p>
<p>From the variable descriptions, we expected <code>borrower_genders</code>to have only two levels, <code>male</code>or <code>female</code>. Here we see there are many more levels, 11,298 to be precise. We know something is wrong here. So we’ll fix that first.</p>
<p>Let’s see if all is well…</p>
<pre><code>[1] &quot;mixed_genders&quot; &quot;mult_females&quot;  &quot;mult_males&quot;    &quot;single_female&quot;
[5] &quot;single_male&quot;  </code></pre>
<p>Nothing <code>strange</code>! Five levels as we wanted - fabulous! Onwards.</p>
<p><strong>c.<code>loan_amounts</code></strong></p>
<p>Now, since we’re trying to predict <code>loan_amounts</code>, it’s better if they’re all in the same currency. Let’s translate them to USD.</p>
<p>It seems like two currencies are returning an error. Let’s filter them out.</p>
<p><strong>d.<code>country_codes</code></strong></p>
<p>Finally, with 86 countries, we have 86 levels. Perhaps it would be interesting to create another category called continent to produce less levels and have a better understanding of the overall function of regional distributions.</p>
<p>Our country codes are in the ISO3166 format, so we will use the associated continent code found <a href="https://dev.maxmind.com/geoip/legacy/codes/country_continent/">here</a>.</p>
<p>We will do what we previously did for currencies, which is to join both tables.</p>
<p>Let’s see what happened…</p>
<pre><code>[1] &quot;AF&quot; &quot;AS&quot; &quot;EU&quot; &quot;OC&quot; &quot;SA&quot;</code></pre>
<p>5 continents! Africa, Asia, Europe, Oceania, and South America. Granted, we’ve lost spacial resolution. However, for our initial purpose, this is exactly what we wanted.</p>
<p><strong>e. Dates</strong></p>
<p>Dates aren’t numeric, but we can make them. Let’s calculate two lengths of time that I think are interesting.
First, how much time passes from the moment the loan is posted to the moment it’s disbursed (<code>total_time</code>). Second, how long does a loan take to get funded (<code>giving_time</code>)?</p>
</div>
<div id="exploratory-data-analysis" class="section level1">
<h1><span class="header-section-number">5</span> Exploratory data analysis</h1>
<p>Now let’s describe the data. We could jump into the regression trees but exploring the data will help us interpret our predictions better. Do some extra work now and enjoy the benefits later.</p>
<p>Let’s make some tables to understand our factors.</p>

<p>Notice most loans are requested by single females, that the least amount of loans are given in the EU, that weekly repayment is an unpopular form of paying the loan back and that entertainment, wholesale, manufacturing, and construction amount less than 2.2% of sectors. Let’s remove these categories that are not representative of the data.</p>
<p>Ideal. Now let’s look at our factors in an easier way to parse. Let’s compare genders by continents to see if we can spot anything worth noting.</p>

<li><p>Who are the givers? Where are they? Does proximity of the lender to the borrower have anything to do with funding times?</p></li>
<li><p>Does the Kiva website have anything to do with funding times? For example, <code>giving_time</code>, the time between posting the loan and the loan being fully funded, has two peaks, at around one week and one month. Is this due to the platform and the promotion of loans that have been posted for a certain amount of time?</p></li>
