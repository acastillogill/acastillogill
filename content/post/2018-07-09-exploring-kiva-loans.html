description: "In this post I analyse 671,205 Kiva loans from around the world. Most loans are requested by single females, EU requests the fewest loans, weekly repayment is an unpopular form of paying back loans and entertainment, wholesale, manufacturing, and construction amount less than 2.2% of sectors. The main uses for Kiva loans are agriculture, retail, and food with some variations amongst regions. Half of the loans are 4.22 USD or less and are funded by 12 or less lenders. The median time between posting on the Kiva platform and disbursing it to the borrower is 16.89 days. I mainly use the tidyverse, stringr, and quantmode packages."

<h1><span class="header-section-number">2</span> Purpose of this post</h1>
<p>Muhammad Yunus and the Grameen Bank won the <a href="https://www.nobelpeaceprize.org/Prize-winners/Winners/2006">Nobel Peace Prize</a> in 2006 for “their efforts through microcredit to create economic and social development from below.”</p>
<p>Back in 1976, Yunus, at the time a professor at the University of Chittagong (Bangladesh), <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-south-asia-11901625">noticed that small amounts of money could make a substantial difference to people living in poverty</a>. He started to loan money to people that didn’t meet the requirements listed by the mainstream banking system. It was reported that these type of loans were effective to <a href="https://www.nobelpeaceprize.org/Prize-winners/Prizewinner-documentation/Muhammad-Yunus-Grameen-Bank">“emerge” from poverty</a> using default rates lower than those of commercial banks, <a href="https://www.gdrc.org/icm/grameen-article4.html">reported at 2%</a>. Eventually, in October 1983, Muhammad Yunus founded <a href="https://grameenfoundation.org/about/history">Grameen Bank</a>, considered to be the first microfinance institution.</p>
<p>Founded in 2005, <a href="https://www.kiva.org/">Kiva</a>, has the same mission as Grameen Bank except that anyone can become a Kiva banker. This online platform enables microcredit lending to help low-income entrepreneurs around the world with a couple of clicks. Pretty neat, huh? In this post, I unpack a large dataset published by <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/kiva/data-science-for-good-kiva-crowdfunding">Kiva on the Kaggle platform</a> and explore these microloans.</p>
</div>
<div id="the-data" class="section level1">
<h1><span class="header-section-number">3</span> The data</h1>
<p>The dataset was published during the first months of 2018 on the <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/kiva/data-science-for-good-kiva-crowdfunding">Kaggle platform</a>.</p>
<p>The complete dataset was a zip file with size 232.7 MB containing four files: <code>kiva_loans.csv</code>, <code>kiva_mpi_region_locations.csv</code>,<code>loan_theme_ids.csv</code>, and <code>loan_themes_by_region.csv</code>. After I looked at the contents, I chose to work with the first one <code>kiva_loans.csv</code>.</p>
<p>The dataset had 671,205 observations and 20 variables.</p>
<p>Some of the codebook came with the dataset and some I researched to make assumptions:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>funded_amount</code>: “The amount disbursed by Kiva to the field agent(USD)”</li>
<li><code>loan_amount</code>: “The amount disbursed by the field agent to the borrower(USD)”</li>
<li><code>activity</code>: “More granular category”</li>
<li><code>sector</code>: “High level category”</li>
<li><code>use</code>: “Exact usage of loan amount”</li>
<li><code>country_code</code>: “ISO country code of country in which loan was disbursed”</li>
<li><code>country</code>: “Full country name of country in which loan was disbursed”</li>
<li><code>region</code>: “Full region name within the country”</li>
<li><code>currency</code>: “The currency in which the loan was disbursed”</li>
<li><code>partner_id</code>: “ID of partner organization”</li>
</ul>
<p>This variable has a lot of missing values and the Kiva explanation on Kaggle doesn’t go much further. For now, I will exclude <code>partner_id</code>.</p>
<ul>
<li><code>posted_time</code>: “The time at which the loan is posted on Kiva by the field agent”</li>
<li><code>disbursed_time</code>: “The time at which the loan is disbursed by the field agent to the borrower”</li>
<li><code>funded_time</code>: “The time at which the loan posted to Kiva gets funded by lenders completely”</li>
<li><code>term_in_months</code>: “The duration for which the loan was disbursed in months”</li>
<li><code>lender_count</code>: “The total number of lenders that contributed to this loan”</li>
<li><code>borrower_genders</code>: “Comma separated M,F letters, where each instance represents a single male/female in the group”</li>
<li><code>repayment_interval</code>: Not specified so I assume that it means the standard definition of when the loan is repaid back to the lender.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div id="data-cleaning" class="section level1">
<h1><span class="header-section-number">4</span> Data cleaning</h1>
<p>By glancing at the data I see there are a few bits that don’t make sense and need to be fixed.</p>
<div id="borrower-gender" class="section level2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">4.1</span> Borrower gender</h2>
<p>From the variable descriptions, I expected <code>borrower_genders</code>to have only two levels, male or female. I see many more levels, 11298 to be precise. This isn’t very clear so I fix that first by creating five levels:</p>
<pre><code>[1] &quot;mixed_genders&quot; &quot;mult_females&quot;  &quot;mult_males&quot;    &quot;single_female&quot;
[5] &quot;single_male&quot;  </code></pre>
</div>
<div id="loan-amounts" class="section level2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">4.2</span> Loan amounts</h2>
<p>Now, since I’m trying to make sense of loans around the world, it’s better if all loans are in the same currency for reference. I use the <code>quantmode</code> package to convert all loans into a single currency (US dollars). There were two currencies that were unavailable.</p>
</div>
<div id="country-codes" class="section level2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">4.3</span> Country codes</h2>
<p>Finally, with 86 countries there are 86 levels. Perhaps it would be interesting to create another category called region to produce less levels and have a better understanding of the overall function of regional distributions.</p>
<p>Country codes are in the ISO-3166 format, so I the associated region code found <a href="https://dev.maxmind.com/geoip/legacy/codes/country_region/">here</a> and created five regions: Africa, Asia, Europe, Oceania, and South America.</p>
<pre><code>[1] &quot;Africa&quot;   &quot;Americas&quot; &quot;Asia&quot;     &quot;Europe&quot;   &quot;Oceania&quot; </code></pre>
</div>
<div id="dates" class="section level2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">4.4</span> Dates</h2>
<p>I calculate two lengths of time that I think are interesting. First, how much time is there between posting the loan to disbursement (<code>total_time</code>). Second, how long does a loan take to get funded (<code>giving_time</code>)?</p>

<p>Here I create three different top ten rankings to order countries by number of total Kiva loans, loans per capita, and by internet users. For the internet users ranking, I used <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_number_of_Internet_users">this ranking</a>, which is based on numbers published by the <a href="https://www.itu.int/en/Pages/default.aspx">International Telecommunications Union</a>.</p>

<h1><span class="header-section-number">6</span> Questions</h1>
<ul>
<li><p>Why is retail and not food (as in other regions) the second most common use for loans in Asia?</p></li>
<li><p>Who are the givers? Where are they? Does proximity of the lender to the borrower have anything to do with funding times?</p></li>
<li><p>Does the Kiva website have anything to do with funding times? For example, <code>giving_time</code>, the time between posting the loan and the loan being fully funded, has two peaks, at around one week and one month. Is this due to the platform and the promotion of loans that have been posted for a certain amount of time?</p></li>
